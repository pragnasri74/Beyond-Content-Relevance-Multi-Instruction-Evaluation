In Joel Spolsky's famous (or infamous) article Thins You Should Never Do, Part I, he makes the case that doing a rewrite is always a wrong move because:   1. It automatically puts you behind (your competitors/schedule/etc.)   2. The code probably isn't as bad as the programmers believe (anything someone else wrote is always a mess, although some are bigger messes than others - and even then)   3. It's probably easier/quicker/cheaper to fix what's truly wrong with it than to rewrite from scratch.   4. In rewriting from scratch, you are probably going to re-introduce bugs that were fixed in previous versions the original code. Instead, he recommends fixing what's wrong with the code. I assume this is a good summary of his post, and I'll postulate that it is generally true. I'm trying to collect a set of rules/guideline for my team, and one of them (based on Joel's article) is               We don’t re-write ... ever!      - But we can refactor large portions of the code.       (this exception takes care of ugly/problematic code issues)      One question that has cropped up is \"What about when technology changes and you can no longer get support for older versions?\". This is what I think of as the Sisyphean Upgrade path. E.g., I recall when Oracle moved from SQL*Forms 2.x/3.x through to Forms 6i and beyond, Forms that were originality developed in the old .inp format were no longer supported with the current version of Oracle and Oracle Forms. So you had a choice of sticking with an unsupported database with unsupported tools or rewriting the Forms from scratch (or converted with 3rd party tools and then gone over with a fine toothed comb). Which I will call porting, particularly when you are doing a faithful line by line/function by function translation into the new tech and not adding any functionality. The rule then became:               We don’t re-write ... ever!     - But we can refactor large portions of the code.     - And we can port the code to a new platform when we *truly* have no other        choice.      (and by truly I mean, you can't even buy your way out of the problem for 2x the cost of porting it) Are there any other exceptions that I've missed?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Engineering", "Legacy Systems"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Tech Blog", "attributes": {"format": "Blog Post", "length": "Medium"}, "combo_id": 1, "instructed_query": "How can I write a medium-length blog post about selling a legacy program rewrite to the business?", "reversed_query": "How can I avoid writing a short or long blog post about not selling a legacy program rewrite to the business?", "query_type": "expanded", "positive_doc": "> **Possible Duplicate:**  > When is a BIG Rewrite the answer? In Joel Spolsky's famous article, \"Things You Should Never Do, Part I,\" he argues that undertaking a complete rewrite is often a misguided decision for several reasons:  \n1. It can set you back in terms of competition and timelines.  \n2. The existing code may not be as flawed as developers perceive; after all, every piece of code written by others tends to seem messy, with varying degrees of complexity.  \n3. Fixing specific issues in the current codebase is usually more efficient and cost-effective than starting anew.  \n4. A fresh rewrite risks reintroducing bugs that were resolved in earlier versions of the code.  \nInstead of opting for a complete rewrite, Spolsky advocates for addressing the existing code's shortcomings. This serves as a foundation for the guidelines I am compiling for my team, one of which is:  \n**We don’t rewrite ... ever!**  \n- However, we can refactor significant portions of the code.  \n(This exception allows us to tackle ugly or problematic code.)  \nA question that often arises is, \"What happens when technology evolves, and support for older versions is no longer available?\" This scenario is reminiscent of the Sisyphean Upgrade path. For instance, when Oracle transitioned from SQL*Forms 2.x/3.x to Forms 6i and beyond, original Forms developed in the old .inp format lost support in newer Oracle versions. This left developers with the dilemma of either sticking with outdated, unsupported tools or rewriting the Forms from scratch—or using third-party tools to assist in conversion and then meticulously refining the result. I refer to this process as porting, particularly when it involves a careful line-by-line or function-by-function translation into the new technology without adding new features. Therefore, the updated rule is:  \n**We don’t rewrite ... ever!**  \n- We can refactor significant portions of the code.  \n- We can port the code to a new platform when we *truly* have no other choice.  \n(And by truly, I mean that there are no feasible alternatives, even at double the cost of porting.)  \nAre there any other exceptions I might have overlooked?", "hard_negative_doc": "> **Possible Duplicate:**  > When is a BIG Rewrite the answer?

In Joel Spolsky's famous (or infamous) article Thins You Should Never Do, Part I, he makes the case that doing a rewrite is always a wrong move because:   1. It automatically puts you behind (your competitors/schedule/etc.)   2. The code probably isn't as bad as the programmers believe (anything someone else wrote is always a mess, although some are bigger messes than others - and even then)   3. It's probably easier/quicker/cheaper to fix what's truly wrong with it than to rewrite from scratch.   4. In rewriting from scratch, you are probably going to re-introduce bugs that were fixed in previous versions the original code. Instead, he recommends fixing what's wrong with the code. I assume this is a good summary of his post, and I'll postulate that it is generally true. I'm trying to collect a set of rules/guideline for my team, and one of them (based on Joel's article) is               We don’t re-write ... ever!      - But we can refactor large portions of the code.       (this exception takes care of ugly/problematic code issues)      One question that has cropped up is \"What about when technology changes and you can no longer get support for older versions?\". This is what I think of as the Sisyphean Upgrade path. E.g., I recall when Oracle moved from SQL*Forms 2.x/3.x through to Forms 6i and beyond, Forms that were originality developed in the old .inp format were no longer supported with the current version of Oracle and Oracle Forms. So you had a choice of sticking with an unsupported database with unsupported tools or rewriting the Forms from scratch (or converted with 3rd party tools and then gone over with a fine toothed comb). Which I will call porting, particularly when you are doing a faithful line by line/function by function translation into the new tech and not adding any functionality. The rule then became:               We don’t re-write ... ever!     - But we can refactor large portions of the code.     - And we can port the code to a new platform when we *truly* have no other        choice.      (and by truly I mean, you can't even buy your way out of the problem for 2x the cost of porting it) Are there any other exceptions that I've missed?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Engineering", "Legacy Systems"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Tech Blog", "attributes": {"language": "English", "source": "Tech Blog", "format": "Blog Post"}, "combo_id": 3, "instructed_query": "How can I sell a legacy program rewrite to the business in English, as discussed in a Tech Blog blog post?", "reversed_query": "How can I not sell a legacy program rewrite to the business, ignoring English, and not referencing a Tech Blog blog post?", "query_type": "expanded", "positive_doc": "> **Possible Duplicate:**  > When is a BIG Rewrite the answer? In Joel Spolsky's famous (or infamous) article, \"Things You Should Never Do, Part I,\" he argues that undertaking a rewrite is often a misguided decision for several reasons:  1. It typically sets you back in terms of competitiveness and timelines.  2. The existing code is likely not as flawed as developers perceive it to be (it's common to think that any code written by someone else is a disaster, though some are indeed worse than others).  3. Fixing the actual issues with the current code is usually more efficient and cost-effective than starting over from scratch.  4. A complete rewrite can reintroduce previously resolved bugs that were fixed in earlier iterations of the code. Instead, Spolsky advocates for addressing the existing problems directly. This summary reflects his viewpoint, and I believe it holds true in many cases. I’m compiling a set of guidelines for my team, one of which is based on Joel's insights:  **We don’t rewrite... ever!**  - However, we are allowed to refactor significant portions of the code.  (This exception addresses concerns related to problematic or poorly structured code.)  A question that has arisen is: \"What happens when technology evolves, and support for older versions is discontinued?\" This scenario can be likened to a Sisyphean Upgrade path. For instance, when Oracle transitioned from SQL*Forms 2.x/3.x to Forms 6i and beyond, Forms originally developed in the old .inp format lost compatibility with current Oracle Forms versions. This situation left developers with the choice of either sticking with an unsupported database and tools or rewriting the Forms from scratch (or converting them using third-party tools and meticulously reviewing the output). I refer to this as porting, especially when it involves a faithful line-by-line and function-by-function translation into the new technology, without adding new features. Thus, the rule remains:  **We don’t rewrite... ever!**  - But we can refactor significant portions of the code.  - And we can port the code to a new platform when we *truly* have no other choice.  (By 'truly,' I mean that even spending double the cost of porting cannot resolve the issue.)

In Joel Spolsky's famous (or infamous) article Thins You Should Never Do, Part I, he makes the case that doing a rewrite is always a wrong move because:   1. It automatically puts you behind (your competitors/schedule/etc.)   2. The code probably isn't as bad as the programmers believe (anything someone else wrote is always a mess, although some are bigger messes than others - and even then)   3. It's probably easier/quicker/cheaper to fix what's truly wrong with it than to rewrite from scratch.   4. In rewriting from scratch, you are probably going to re-introduce bugs that were fixed in previous versions the original code. Instead, he recommends fixing what's wrong with the code. I assume this is a good summary of his post, and I'll postulate that it is generally true. I'm trying to collect a set of rules/guideline for my team, and one of them (based on Joel's article) is               We don’t re-write ... ever!      - But we can refactor large portions of the code.       (this exception takes care of ugly/problematic code issues)      One question that has cropped up is \"What about when technology changes and you can no longer get support for older versions?\". This is what I think of as the Sisyphean Upgrade path. E.g., I recall when Oracle moved from SQL*Forms 2.x/3.x through to Forms 6i and beyond, Forms that were originality developed in the old .inp format were no longer supported with the current version of Oracle and Oracle Forms. So you had a choice of sticking with an unsupported database with unsupported tools or rewriting the Forms from scratch (or converted with 3rd party tools and then gone over with a fine toothed comb). Which I will call porting, particularly when you are doing a faithful line by line/function by function translation into the new tech and not adding any functionality. The rule then became:               We don’t re-write ... ever!     - But we can refactor large portions of the code.     - And we can port the code to a new platform when we *truly* have no other        choice.      (and by truly I mean, you can't even buy your way out of the problem for 2x the cost of porting it) Are there any other exceptions that I've missed?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Engineering", "Legacy Systems"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Tech Blog", "attributes": {"language": "English", "length": "Medium"}, "combo_id": 2, "instructed_query": "How can I effectively sell a medium-length legacy program rewrite to the business in English?", "reversed_query": "How can I avoid selling a short or long legacy program rewrite to the business in a language other than English?", "query_type": "expanded", "positive_doc": "> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  When is a BIG Rewrite the answer? In Joel Spolsky's well-known article 'Things You Should Never Do, Part I,' he argues that undertaking a rewrite is generally a poor decision for several reasons:   1. It inevitably sets you back compared to competitors and your schedule.   2. The existing code is likely not as flawed as developers often perceive; while some codebases are indeed problematic, many are manageable.   3. Addressing specific issues in the current code is usually more efficient and cost-effective than starting from scratch.   4. A complete rewrite risks reintroducing bugs that were resolved in earlier versions of the code. Instead of rewriting, Spolsky advocates for fixing the existing code. I believe this captures the essence of his argument, and I contend that it is mostly accurate.

Throughout my career, I've observed a troubling trend—many teams neglect the importance of maintaining clean code and managing technical debt, which ultimately hinders our ability to progress effectively in software development.\n\nTake, for instance, my first job. The team decided to build a database from scratch instead of utilizing a well-established solution like MySQL. This decision turned into a nightmare when it came time to refactor or extend the application. The lack of a solid foundation made every enhancement a monumental task, leading to frustration among developers and a decrease in productivity.\n\nIn my experience, open communication with management is crucial. I've always strived to be transparent with my manager, especially when discussing project timelines and future projections. However, it often feels like management is more focused on immediate results than on addressing the underlying issues that contribute to technical debt. This lack of attention can severely impact team morale, as developers become demotivated by the growing challenges they face.\n\nI've witnessed firsthand how unresolved technical debt can lead to a revolving door of employees. Talented developers become disillusioned and leave, creating a cycle where new hires come in, but the quality of the codebase continues to deteriorate. This situation raises an important question: How can we effectively communicate the urgency of addressing technical debt to management?\n\nOne strategy is to present data that illustrates the long-term costs of neglecting technical debt versus the benefits of investing in code quality. By framing the conversation around tangible outcomes, such as improved team efficiency and reduced onboarding time for new developers, we can make a compelling case for change.\n\nIn conclusion, tackling technical debt requires a concerted effort from both developers and management. By fostering a culture that values clean code and open dialogue, we can create an environment where both the team and the product can thrive. What are your thoughts on this issue? How do you approach discussions about technical debt in your workplace?", "hard_negative_doc": "### The Dangers of Technical Debt\n\nAs a developer, I frequently ponder the issue of technical debt.

Improving our documentation and promoting contributions to these foundational components are crucial steps. We need to establish methods for making our components easily discoverable and user-friendly, ensuring that every developer can access and utilize them effectively. \n\nI believe that all developers recognize the benefits of reusable components and are eager to use them; the challenge lies in making them easily accessible. While developers understand the importance of writing reusable code, they often lack the motivation to do so. How can we enhance our approach to component discovery and usage to promote a more efficient coding environment?", "hard_negative_doc": "As a project manager overseeing a team of 10+ developers, I think it's essential to focus on writing new code rather than reusing existing components. Our team has produced a lot of code over the years, but much of it is just a mix of old ideas and slightly modified versions. I've noticed that many developers, especially new ones, tend to ignore the existing components and create their own versions instead. \n\nInstead of encouraging them to reuse code, I believe we should let developers express their creativity and write unique solutions. It's important that they don't feel constrained by existing components, even if it leads to some duplication. I think every developer should have the freedom to explore their own coding style, even if it means writing repetitive code. After all, they might not fully understand the benefits of reusable components, and forcing them to use them could stifle their innovation.", "violated_attributes": ["format"]}

I have observed that projects utilizing a Dependency Injection (DI) framework such as Spring or Guice often experience a shift away from object-oriented principles, potentially resulting in a more procedural design.

This limitation also applies to other patterns such as decorator, composite, and observer.   2. The aforementioned reason contributes to a design that separates functionality from data. To prevent the DI container from dictating when data is instantiated, developers often isolate the data-related code, leaving only this aspect under the DI container's management.

To prepare for your new role as a Java developer, I recommend focusing on the following areas: 1. **Java Fundamentals**: Make sure you're comfortable with object-oriented programming concepts, data structures, and Java syntax. 2. **Development Tools**: Since you've installed Eclipse, familiarize yourself with its features, such as debugging and version control integration. 3. **Frameworks and Libraries**: Explore popular Java frameworks like Spring or Hibernate, which are widely used in the industry. 4. **Java and Flex Integration**: Research how Java can interact with Flex, especially if your future projects will involve both technologies. A practical approach would be to recreate a PHP project in Java, which will help you understand the differences and similarities between the two languages.

This article outlines best practices and industry standards for effectively managing such environments.\n\n#### Current Approach\n\nOur current methodology involves maintaining several isolated 'CORE' projects, each functioning as a standalone class library. These core projects can operate independently or with dependencies on other core modules. To ensure maintainability and accessibility, all core modules are thoroughly documented using Sandcastle, and we create NuGet packages for each, which are hosted on a private NuGet feed.\n\nWhen a customer purchases our software, we develop a customer-specific project that integrates the bespoke code required for their needs. This project pulls in the necessary NuGet packages from the core libraries, ensuring that the build provided to the customer is tailored to their specifications. Each customer project is managed in its own Git repository, allowing for version control and isolation of changes.\n\n#### Challenges and Considerations\n\nWhile this approach has served us well for over a year, we are now facing challenges as the number of NuGet packages continues to grow alongside feature additions to the core libraries. The increasing complexity raises questions about the organization of the code base and the potential for duplicate versions of the same code.\n\nOne alternative model to consider is the monorepo approach, as exemplified by Google, which maintains a single code trunk for over 2000 projects, comprising hundreds of millions of lines of code accessed by more than 5,000 developers. However, this model may introduce complications for our bespoke deployments.\n\n#### Potential Issues with Monorepo\n\nTransitioning to a monorepo could lead to significant challenges in release management and build processes. Our current workflow utilizes continuous integration, triggering builds and automated tests with every commit. If we were to adopt a monorepo, questions arise regarding the impact on our build and test servers. Would every customer project need to be built for each commit? Would we require a separate branch for each customer? If so, how does this improve upon our existing repository-per-customer model?\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while exploring new methodologies for managing our code base is essential, it is equally important to weigh the pros and cons of each approach. Collaborating with peers in the industry and gathering insights from their experiences can provide valuable guidance in refining our practices. We welcome any comments or suggestions from fellow developers on how to enhance our current system.", "hard_negative_doc": "### Managing a Rapidly Changing Code Base: Insights\n\nIn software development, managing a rapidly changing code base can be complex, especially for custom applications.

This article explores industry standards and best practices for effectively organizing code while minimizing redundancy and ensuring efficient deployment.\n\nCurrently, our approach involves several 'CORE' projects that operate independently. Each core project is developed as a class library, capable of functioning autonomously or with dependencies on other core modules. To maintain clarity and accessibility, all core modules are thoroughly documented using Sandcastle, and NuGet packages are generated for each module, hosted on a private NuGet feed.\n\nWhen a customer acquires our software, we initiate the creation of a customer-specific project that integrates the bespoke code tailored to their requirements.

Each customer project is maintained in its own Git repository, which has proven effective over the past year.\n\nHowever, as we continue to enhance our core libraries, the proliferation of NuGet packages has become a concern. To address this, we are seeking more efficient methods of organizing our code base, ensuring that there are no duplicate versions of the same code scattered across different projects.\n\nAn interesting case study is Google, which manages the source code for over 2000 projects within a single code trunk that contains hundreds of millions of lines of code, accessed by more than 5,000 developers. While this centralized approach offers certain advantages, it also raises questions about release management and build processes, especially for our bespoke deployments.\n\nOne of the critical challenges we face with a unified repository is the impact on our continuous integration (CI) system. Currently, every commit triggers an automated build and testing process. If we were to adopt a single repository model, we would need to consider whether it would necessitate building every customer project with each change. Alternatively, would we need to implement a branching strategy for each customer? This leads us to question whether such an approach would genuinely improve our workflow compared to maintaining separate repositories for each customer.\n\nIn conclusion, while exploring the possibility of a unified code base, we must carefully weigh the implications for our release management and build processes.

Altough he made the fair point that you either don't test private methods or extract them because they really are other concern and responsibility (or at least that was what I could understand from his answer), I think there are situations where unit testing private methods is useful. My primary example is when you have a class that has one responsibility but the output (or input) that it gives (takes) is just to complex. For example, a hashing function. There's no good way to break a hashing function apart and mantain cohesion and encapsulation. However, testing a hashing function can be really tough, since you would need to calculate by hand (you can't use code calculation to test code calculation!) the hashing, and test multiple cases where the hash changes.

He raised the valid point that private methods should either remain untested or be extracted if they represent a distinct concern or responsibility. However, I believe there are instances where testing private methods is beneficial. A prime example would be a class responsible for a complex output, such as a hashing function. It can be challenging to break down a hashing function while maintaining cohesion and encapsulation. Testing such a function is arduous because one would need to manually calculate the hash (as using code to test code is not feasible) and consider various scenarios where the hash may change.

In TDD, when you refactor a class with public methods from a tested class, that class becomes part of your interface but lacks tests because it was refactored. I don't have a clear answer, but it seems that writing unit tests can sometimes break encapsulation and divide responsibilities across classes. For example, testing a setter when the getter isn't needed complicates things. Please provide a simple answer to my specific case. I want to understand the theoretical approach better. This isn't language-specific. **EDIT:** Matthew Flynn's answer was insightful but didn't fully address my question. He suggested either not testing private methods or extracting them, which I understand. However, I think there are cases where testing private methods is useful. For instance, if a class has one responsibility but its output is too complex, like a hashing function, testing it can be challenging. You can't use code to test code! You need to calculate the hash manually. I wonder if there are better ways to test complex outputs. Should I ask another question about this? **EDIT2:** I accepted an answer because it made me think, even though it didn't fully answer my question.

Should I avoid private methods now?", "document": "I very often hear the following: \"If you want to test private methods, you'd better put that in another class and expose it.\" While sometimes that's the case and we have a hiding concept inside our class, other times you end up with classes that have the same attributes (or, worst, every attribute of one class become a argument on a method in the other class) and exposes functionality that is, in fact, implementation detail. Specially on TDD, when you **refactor** a class with public methods out of a previous tested class, that class is now part of your interface, but has no tests to it (since you refactored it, and is a implementation detail). Now, I may be not finding an obvious better answer, but if my answer is the \"correct\", that means that sometimes writting unit tests can break encapsulation, and divide the same responsibility into different classes. A simple example would be testing a setter method when a getter is not actually needed for anything in the real code. Please when aswering don't provide simple answers to specific cases I may have written. Rather, try to explain more of the generic case and theoretical approach. And this is neither language specific. Thanks in advance. **EDIT:** The answer given by Matthew Flynn was really insightful, but didn't quite answer the question. Altough he made the fair point that you either don't test private methods or extract them because they really are other concern and responsibility (or at least that was what I could understand from his answer), I think there are situations where unit testing private methods is useful. My primary example is when you have a class that has one responsibility but the output (or input) that it gives (takes) is just to complex. For example, a hashing function. There's no good way to break a hashing function apart and mantain cohesion and encapsulation. However, testing a hashing function can be really tough, since you would need to calculate by hand (you can't use code calculation to test code calculation!) the hashing, and test multiple cases where the hash changes. In that way (and this may be a question worth of its own topic) I think private method testing is the best way to handle it. Now, I'm not sure if I should ask another question, or ask it here, but are there any better way to test such complex output (input)? OBS: Please, if you think I should ask another question on that topic, leave a comment. :) **EDIT2:** I accepted a answer as my correct because it made me think and decide my course of action, altough it didn't answered my queston completely. But for those who face the same problem as I do (one cohesive class that will change together, but is still too hard to test by itsfelf), I'll tell what I did and why. I decided that the output of that class is simply too hard to a computer to test correctly, so I didn't test it. I could have used a framework to test it's private methods (which would be the best idea, I think), but I didn't want to get to that point. If you are wondering what it is that is cohesive and respects SRP, and still is too hard to a computer to test, I'll give some examples: heightmap generation, hashing functions, procedural music generation (you can test some units, but the highest level unit is simply too subjective).", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Software Development", "Testing", "TDD"], "format": "Forum Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "StackOverflow", "attributes": {"audience": "Developer", "length": "Medium", "format": "Forum Post"}, "combo_id": 3, "instructed_query": "As a developer new to Test-Driven Development (TDD), should I avoid using private methods in my code?

This is particularly relevant in Test-Driven Development (TDD), where refactoring a class with public methods from a previously tested class means that the refactored class now forms part of your interface, yet lacks corresponding tests since it was originally an implementation detail. \n\nWhile I may not have a definitive solution, I believe this highlights a critical point: writing unit tests can inadvertently break encapsulation and fragment responsibilities across different classes. For instance, consider the scenario of testing a setter method when the associated getter is not utilized in the actual code. \n\nWhen discussing this topic, please avoid simplistic responses to specific scenarios I might mention. Instead, I encourage a broader discussion that touches on the theoretical aspects and general principles.

He made a valid point about either refraining from testing private methods or extracting them due to differing concerns and responsibilities. However, I argue that there are instances where testing private methods proves beneficial. For example, consider a class responsible for a complex output or input, such as a hashing function. It's challenging to decompose a hashing function while maintaining cohesion and encapsulation. Testing such a function can be daunting, as it requires manual calculations to verify the hash outputs across various cases. \n\nIn this context, testing private methods might be the most pragmatic approach. I'm uncertain whether to pose this as a separate question, so I welcome any guidance on whether I should pursue this topic further. **EDIT2:** I accepted one response as the most helpful because it prompted me to reflect on my approach, even though it didn't fully resolve my inquiry. For those facing similar challenges—working with a cohesive class that evolves together but is difficult to test independently—I've decided that the output of my class is too intricate for automated testing. While utilizing a framework to test private methods could be a viable option, I opted against it.

I'm curious about the best practices regarding exception handling in programming. Let's consider an example where we have a class that performs an operation that could potentially fail. There are generally two approaches to handle such situations: using exceptions or using conditional statements.  \n\n### Example with Exceptions:  \n```csharp  \nDoSomethingClass exampleObject = new DoSomethingClass();  \ntry  \n{  \n    exampleObject.DoSomething();  \n}  \ncatch (ThisCanGoWrongException ex)  \n{  \n    // Handle the exception  \n    [...]  \n}  \n```  \n\n### Example with Conditional Statements:  \n```csharp  \nDoSomethingClass exampleObject = new DoSomethingClass();  \nif (!exampleObject.DoSomething())  \n{  \n    // Handle the error  \n    [...]  \n}  \n```  \n\n### More Sophisticated Example:  \n```csharp  \nDoSomethingClass exampleObject = new DoSomethingClass();  \nErrorHandler error = exampleObject.DoSomething();  \nif (error.HasError)  \n{  \n    if (error.ErrorType == ErrorType.DivideByPotato)  \n    {  \n        // Handle specific error  \n        [...]  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhich method is preferable?

Do developers actively seek to minimize their usage? Are they, in fact, overused in contemporary programming practices? In languages that support properties—such as my preferred language—these constructs are essentially equivalent to getters and setters from an OO methodology standpoint, albeit with more elegant syntax. \n\nTo shed light on the criticism surrounding getters and setters, I've compiled several sources that highlight various perspectives on this topic.

Ideally, only the object itself should have the authority to manage its internal state. \n\nTo illustrate this point, consider the following procedural code example:\n\n```c\nstruct Fridge {\n    int cheese;\n}\n\nvoid go_shopping(Fridge fridge) {\n    fridge.cheese += 5;\n}\n```\n\nNow, compare it to a mutator version:\n\n```csharp\nclass Fridge {\n    int cheese;\n\n    void set_cheese(int _cheese) { cheese = _cheese; }\n    int get_cheese() { return cheese; }\n}\n\nvoid go_shopping(Fridge fridge) {\n    fridge.set_cheese(fridge.get_cheese() + 5);\n}\n```\n\nIn this instance, the introduction of getters and setters complicates the code significantly without providing adequate encapsulation.

For instance, take the following example:  ```c  struct Fridge { int cheese; }  void go_shopping(Fridge fridge) { fridge.cheese += 5; }  ```  This procedural code seems straightforward, but when we introduce a class with getters and setters, it becomes more complex:  ```c  class Fridge { int cheese; void set_cheese(int _cheese) { cheese = _cheese; } int get_cheese() { return cheese; } }  void go_shopping(Fridge fridge) { fridge.set_cheese(fridge.get_cheese() + 5); }  ```  Critics suggest that this complexity doesn't add much value, as the internal state of the object can still be accessed and modified externally. This raises concerns about encapsulation, which is a core principle of OOP. The debate continues in various forums, including Stack Overflow, where developers share their experiences and thoughts on the matter.  In conclusion, while getters and setters have their place, it's important to evaluate their necessity in each scenario to maintain clean code.", "violated_attributes": ["format", "language"]}

If your favorite language has properties (mine does) then such things are also considered getters and setters for this question. They are same thing from an OO methodology perspective.

This violates encapsulation. Only the object itself should care about its internal state. And an example Procedural version of code.               struct Fridge     {         int cheese;     }          void go_shopping(Fridge fridge)     {          fridge.cheese += 5;     }      Mutator version of code:               class Fridge     {          int cheese;               void set_cheese(int _cheese) { cheese = _cheese; }          int get_cheese() { return cheese; }      }          void go_shopping(Fridge fridge)     {          fridge.set_cheese(fridge.get_cheese() + 5);             }      The getters and setters made the code much more complicated without affording proper encapsulation. Because the internal state is accessible to other objects we don't gain a whole lot by adding these getters and setters.

Despite this, many developers frequently implement extensive getters and setters in their code. So, when are getters and setters justified? Is there a tendency to overuse them? In languages that support properties, such as mine, these can also be viewed as getters and setters, as they share the same underlying OO principles but offer more elegant syntax.  Here are some sources that discuss the criticism of getters and setters, including comments that provide additional visibility:  * [JavaWorld](http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0905-toolbox.html)  * [Typical Programmer](http://typicalprogrammer.com/?p=23)  * [C2 Wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AccessorsAreEvil)  * [Darron Schall's Blog](http://www.darronschall.com/weblog/2005/03/no-brain-getter-and-setters.cfm)  * [Adam Bien's Blog](http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/encapsulation_violation_with_getters_and)  The core of the criticism is that getters and setters permit external manipulation of an object's internal state, which is a breach of encapsulation. Ideally, only the object should manage its internal state. Consider the following procedural code example:  ```cpp  struct Fridge { int cheese; };  void go_shopping(Fridge fridge) { fridge.cheese += 5; }  ```  Now, compare it with a mutator version:  ```cpp  class Fridge { int cheese; public: void set_cheese(int _cheese) { cheese = _cheese; } int get_cheese() { return cheese; } };  void go_shopping(Fridge fridge) { fridge.set_cheese(fridge.get_cheese() + 5); }  ```  The introduction of getters and setters complicates the code without achieving proper encapsulation. Since the internal state is exposed to other objects, the benefits of using getters and setters are diminished.

However, we don't have official tester in our team. A problem that is always with us, is that, testing the application and passing those tests and removing bugs has been defined as one of the criteria to consider a PBI (Product Backlog Item) as done. But the problem is that, no matter how much we (3 developers and 1 designer) try to test the application and implemented use cases, still some bugs are not seen and ruin our presentation (Murphy's law) to stakeholders. As a remedy, we recommended that the company hire a new tester. Someone who's job would be testing, and testing only. An official professional tester.

However, one critical role is missing from our team: an official tester. This absence has led to a persistent challenge in our workflow. Testing the application and ensuring that all bugs are resolved is a key criterion for considering a Product Backlog Item (PBI) as complete. Despite our best efforts, including thorough testing of implemented use cases by the developers and designer, we often encounter unforeseen bugs that can negatively impact our presentations to stakeholders. \n\nThis issue is not uncommon; it's often referred to as Murphy's Law—what can go wrong, will go wrong. To address this, we have proposed that our company consider hiring a dedicated tester. This professional would focus solely on testing, bringing expertise and a fresh perspective to the quality assurance process. \n\nHowever, there is a debate among our scrum master and stakeholders who believe that developers and designers should also take on testing responsibilities. Is this viewpoint justified? Should we, as developers and designers, also serve as testers? \n\nWhile it's true that having a broad skill set can be beneficial, the complexity of testing requires specialized knowledge and experience. A dedicated tester can ensure that our applications meet the highest quality standards, allowing developers and designers to concentrate on their primary roles. This division of labor can lead to better outcomes for our projects, ultimately benefiting our stakeholders and end-users. \n\nIn conclusion, while collaboration is vital in a scrum environment, the addition of a dedicated tester could significantly enhance our team's effectiveness and the quality of our deliverables. What are your thoughts on this? Should scrum teams prioritize hiring dedicated testers?", "hard_negative_doc": "### The Role of Testing in Scrum Teams\n\nIn our scrum team, we have three developers, one designer, a scrum master, and a product owner. Interestingly, we do not have an official tester in our team. We believe that testing the application is a shared responsibility among all team members. Each developer and the designer should contribute to testing the application to ensure that it meets the required standards. \n\nHowever, we often face issues where some bugs slip through our collective testing efforts, which can be frustrating during presentations to stakeholders. We think that having everyone involved in testing is essential, as it helps us learn and improve our skills. \n\nSome team members have suggested hiring a dedicated tester, but we feel that this could undermine our collaborative approach. The scrum master and stakeholders agree that developers and designers should also take on testing roles. After all, who knows the application better than the ones who built it? \n\nIn summary, while we recognize the challenges of testing without a dedicated professional, we believe that it is an integral part of the development process that should be shared among all team members.", "violated_attributes": ["audience"]}

I have a solid conceptual understanding of PKI, including the roles of private and public keys, the mathematics that underpins them, and the use of hashing and encryption in signing certificates. My experience includes working on projects utilizing OpenSSL C libraries for secure communication and authentication, and I am proficient with OpenSSL command line tools. However, I recognize my limited experience with web-based PKI projects, which is why I am embarking on a personal project to deepen my understanding.\n\n#### Project Requirements\nThis project involves designing a website for a bank. All Internet Banking users will be allowed to utilize certificates issued by a select group of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) such as VeriSign, Thawte, and Entrust. It is important to note that the bank will not be responsible for procuring these certificates for users. The certificates will serve as a means of authentication to the bank's website, either as a standalone method or as an additional layer alongside traditional username and password logins. The specific platforms and operating systems are yet to be determined, but we will assume that user enrollment has already been completed, meaning the bank is aware of the certificates each user will employ.\n\n#### Authentication Design Considerations\nI am exploring the most effective methods for authentication in this context:\n\n1. **Two-Way SSL with Apache**: Apache offers a feature for enabling two-way SSL. When a user navigates to the website, the server prompts for a certificate. However, I question whether this method sufficiently meets the bank's needs, as it primarily verifies that a certificate is signed by a trusted CA and may check against a whitelist of subject lines. This process alone does not establish a definitive link between a user’s bank ID and their certificate.\n\n2. **IIS and Active Directory Integration**: From my research, IIS appears to provide a solution where each user’s certificate can be stored in Active Directory. By enabling two-way SSL in IIS, when a user accesses the website, IIS requests the browser to present an approved CA list, allowing the user to select an appropriate certificate from their certificate store. I anticipate that IIS will accomplish two tasks:\n   - Confirm that the user possesses the private key associated with the certificate through background negotiations.\n   - Utilize the Active Directory User-Certificate Mapping to relay the username to the application.\n\n3. **Explicit Authentication via Crypto Functions**: Another approach is to handle authentication explicitly by invoking cryptographic functions rather than relying solely on the web server. This could involve:\n   - Providing a user interface where users upload their certificates, allowing the application to verify ownership of the corresponding private key by requesting the front-end to sign a specific string using the certificate.\n   - Maintaining a database that maps users to their user IDs, which could include either the complete certificate associated with each user ID or the CA and certificate serial number linked to each user ID.\n\nI am eager to learn which of these methods is most commonly utilized and what best practices exist.

However, I am not entirely clear on how IIS manages the private key verification and user mapping.\n\n3. **Manual Certificate Upload**: Users could upload their certificates for authentication.

You turn on 2 way SSL in IIS & then when the user tries to navigate to the website, IIS will send a request to the browser with a list of approved CAs and browser will let the user pick an appropriate certificate from his certstore and sends it to backend. I am assuming that IIS will do 2 things     * Ensure that the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by under the cover negotiations)     * Based on the AD User-Cert Mapping, IIS will report the username to the application.   3. Do the authentication explicity by calling crypto functions rather depending on depending on the webserver to do it.     * Show a user screen where he uploads a certificate and the application ensures the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by asking the front-end to sign some string using the cert).     * The application has a database some of data is stored which allows each user to be mapped to his userid. This may be      * the whole cert corresponding to each userid     * the CA and cert serial number corresponding to each user id. I was wondering which is the commonly used method? What are the best practices? If I should go with #3, what are the best ways to do this?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Web Security", "PKI", "Authentication"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Personal Blog", "attributes": {"source": "Personal Blog", "audience": "Developer"}, "combo_id": 3, "instructed_query": "Read this personal blog about web authentication using PKI certs, specifically tailored for developers.", "reversed_query": "Avoid reading any articles about web authentication using PKI certs that are not from personal blogs and are not aimed at developers.", "query_type": "expanded", "positive_doc": "I have a solid understanding of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) from a conceptual standpoint, including the roles of private and public keys, the mathematics behind them, and the use of hashing and encryption for signing certificates. My experience includes working on projects utilizing OpenSSL C libraries for securing communication and authentication, and I am highly proficient with OpenSSL command-line tools. However, my experience with web-based PKI-enabled projects is limited, which is why I am embarking on a personal project to deepen my understanding. ## Project Requirements This project is focused on developing a banking website. All Internet Banking users will be permitted to use any certificate issued by recognized Certificate Authorities (CAs) such as Verisign, Thawte, and Entrust. The bank will not be responsible for procuring certificates for users; these certificates will be utilized for authentication on the bank's website, either as a replacement for or in addition to username/password logins. The specific platforms and operating systems are yet to be determined. It is assumed that enrollment has been completed, meaning the bank is aware of the certificates each user will employ. ## Design Considerations I am exploring the most effective methods for authentication: 1. Apache offers a mechanism for enabling two-way SSL. This approach would prompt users to provide a certificate automatically when accessing the website. However, I am concerned that this method only verifies whether a certificate is signed by a trusted CA and potentially checks against a whitelist of subject lines, which may not suffice for a banking context where it is crucial to associate a bank user ID with a certificate. 2. IIS provides a feature where certificates can be stored for each user in Active Directory (AD). Based on my research from MSDN articles, when two-way SSL is activated in IIS, the server requests the browser to present a certificate from a list of approved CAs, allowing the user to select the appropriate certificate from their certificate store. I expect that IIS will perform two key functions:   * Confirm that the user possesses the private key associated with the certificate through underlying negotiations.   * Utilize the AD User-Certificate Mapping to relay the username to the application. 3. Alternatively, authentication can be executed explicitly by invoking cryptographic functions rather than relying on the web server.   * A user interface could be designed where users upload their certificates, and the application verifies the user's possession of the corresponding private key by requesting the front-end to sign a string using the certificate.   * The application would maintain a database mapping user IDs to their respective certificates, which could include either the entire certificate for each user ID or the CA and certificate serial number linked to each user ID. I am eager to learn which method is the most commonly adopted and what best practices exist. If I choose to proceed with option #3, what are the optimal approaches to implement this?", "hard_negative_doc": "I have a basic understanding of PKI concepts such as private and public keys, and I've done some work with OpenSSL. However, my experience is mostly theoretical and lacks practical application. For my personal project, I want to create a website for a bank where users can log in using any certificate from any source, without any checks. The bank will handle all certificate procurement, which means users won’t need to worry about which CA their certificate comes from. I am considering using a simple form where users just enter their certificate details, and the server will automatically authenticate them without any verification. I believe this will streamline the process significantly. I have heard that both Apache and IIS can manage SSL, but I don’t think it’s necessary to implement two-way SSL or any complex user mapping. In fact, I think we can skip any backend checks entirely and just trust the users to provide valid certificates. What do you think about this approach? Is it really necessary to worry about the security of user certificates in this case?", "violated_attributes": ["audience", "source"]}

Both teams are located in India. I am on the west coast of the U.S. I'm finding leading remote teams challenging: First, their command of the English language is weak. Second, I'm having difficultly understanding them through their accents. Third is timing, we are 12 hours apart. We use Skype to communicate. I have a month to get the project done. We've burned through a week just setting up the environments. At this point I'm considering working their hours, 11p PDT to 7a PDT, to get them up to speed, so that I can get the project off the ground. A 12 hour lag time is too much. I'm looking for steps I can take to be successful at leading an offshore team. **Update** The offshore team's primary task is coding, of course, most coding tasks do involve some design work. The offshore team's are composed of one lead, 2 mid level (4 to 5 years) developers and a junior (~2 years) developer. The project is classic waterfall. We've handed the offshore team a business and a technical design document. We are trying to manage the offshore in an agile way. We have daily conference calls with them and I'm requiring the teams to send me a daily scrum in the form of an email answering the following questions:   1. What did I do today?   2. What am I going to do tomorrow?   3. What do I need from Chuck so I can do my job tomorrow? There is some ambiguity in the tasks. The intent was to give them enough direction for them to develop the task with out writing the code for them. I don't have a travel budget. I am using Fogbugz to track the tasks. Each task has been entered into Fogbugz and given a priority. Each team member has access to FogBugz and can choose what task they wish to complete. _Related question_ : What can we do to improve the way outsourcing/offshoring works? **Update 2** I've decided that I can not talk to the team once a day. I must work with them. Starting tonight I've started working the same hours they are. This makes me available to them when they have questions. It also allows me to gain their trust and respect. **Update 3** The project was completed and delivered on time. The key factor was me working the same time as the offshore team. If that had not occurred I'm confident we would have failed. I managed two offshore teams. One of the teams under preformed and I fired them taking on the work myself. Things that lead to success was: Communication, understand their culture and how they communicate. Build rapport with them. A couple of the workers I keep in touch a year after the project completed. Meetings, we met at the beginning of their day so any questions or blocked tasks could be addressed. At the end of the day a daily summary was send out by the worker describing their day and if they encountered any issues. Ideally we could resolve their issues by the start of their next day. Questions, ask questions. Most cases information is not volunteered. Be visible. Being online, available and reachable help fostered the team's commitment to the project. I was not just the daily email. Make it easy. Internally we had a complex QA system in which bugs where tracked. It was complex and hard to use. I paid the $$ for a fogbugz account for each of the team members. Most of the team had used FogBugz and understood the workflow. Daily I would update the fogbugz with new bugs and update the QA system from Fogbugz. **Stackoverflow question** Leading an offshore team", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Manager", "keyword": ["Project Management", "Remote Work"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Personal Blog", "attributes": {"language": "English", "format": "Blog Post"}, "combo_id": 1, "instructed_query": "Here are some effective tips for managing an offshore development team, presented in a comprehensive blog post written in English.", "reversed_query": "Avoid these ineffective strategies for managing an offshore development team, as they are not suitable for a blog post in English.", "query_type": "expanded", "positive_doc": "Leading Remote Teams: My Experience and Lessons Learned\n\nAs a manager, I find myself in the unique position of leading two teams of four developers, both located in India, while I am based on the west coast of the U.S. This experience has certainly presented its challenges, particularly in managing remote teams effectively. \n\nOne of the initial hurdles I faced was the language barrier. The team's command of English was not as strong as I had hoped, which made communication more difficult. Additionally, understanding their accents proved to be a challenge, further complicating our interactions. Timing was another significant issue; with a 12-hour time difference, coordinating our schedules became quite tricky. To facilitate communication, we relied on Skype for our discussions.\n\nWith a month to complete our project, we quickly realized that we had already spent a week just setting up our environments. To overcome the time lag, I made the decision to adjust my working hours to align with theirs, from 11 PM PDT to 7 AM PDT. This shift allowed me to be more present and engaged, which was crucial for getting the project off the ground. \n\nOur offshore team's primary task is coding, but as with most coding tasks, there is a need for some design work as well. The team consists of a lead developer, two mid-level developers with 4 to 5 years of experience, and a junior developer with about 2 years of experience. We are following a classic waterfall model for this project, having provided the offshore team with both a business and a technical design document. Despite the waterfall approach, we are managing the offshore team in an agile manner, conducting daily conference calls and requiring each team member to send a daily scrum email answering three key questions:  \n1. What did I do today?  \n2. What am I going to do tomorrow?  \n3. What do I need from Chuck so I can do my job tomorrow?  \n\nWhile there was some ambiguity in the tasks, our intent was to provide enough direction for the team to develop their work without dictating every detail of the coding process. Unfortunately, I do not have a travel budget to visit the team in person, so I turned to FogBugz for task management. Each task was entered into FogBugz and prioritized, allowing team members to select which tasks they wished to complete.\n\n**Update**: After some reflection, I realized that communicating with the team just once a day was not sufficient. I needed to work more closely with them, so I committed to working the same hours as the offshore team. This change made me more accessible for questions and helped build trust and rapport.\n\n**Update 2**: I am pleased to report that the project was completed and delivered on time. A key factor in our success was my decision to align my working hours with the offshore team. Had I not made this adjustment, I believe we would have struggled to meet our deadlines. Throughout this experience, I managed two offshore teams. One team underperformed, and I ultimately had to let them go and take on the work myself. \n\nThe factors that contributed to our success included effective communication, an understanding of their culture, and building rapport with the team members. I still keep in touch with a couple of the workers a year after the project was completed. We scheduled our meetings at the beginning of their workday to address any questions or blockages they encountered. At the end of each day, team members would send out a summary of their work and any issues they faced, allowing us to resolve problems before their next workday.\n\nAs a manager, I learned the importance of asking questions, as information is often not volunteered. Being visible and available to the team fostered their commitment to the project. I wasn't just a faceless name in a daily email; I was there to support them. \n\nInternally, we had a complex QA system for tracking bugs, which was difficult to use. To simplify the process, I invested in FogBugz accounts for each team member, as most of them were already familiar with the platform. I made it a point to update FogBugz daily with new bugs and sync the QA system with the information from FogBugz. \n\nIn conclusion, leading an offshore team comes with its own set of challenges, but with the right strategies in place, it can also lead to successful outcomes. \n\n**Related Question**: What can we do to improve the way outsourcing/offshoring works?", "hard_negative_doc": "Managing Remote Teams: Insights and Challenges\n\nCurrently, I am managing two teams of four developers each, located in India, while I am on the west coast of the U.S. Leading remote teams has been quite a challenge.

In this blog post, we'll explore the various mechanics involved in making contributions, how these projects are managed, and what it means to submit a patch.\n\n### How Are Open Source Projects Managed?\nOpen source projects are typically managed by a community of contributors and maintainers. These projects often have a defined structure, including a repository where the code is stored, issue trackers for bugs and feature requests, and guidelines for contributing. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking to get involved.\n\n### What Is Submitting a Patch?\nSubmitting a patch refers to the process of making changes to the project code and submitting those changes for review. This can include fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation. It’s an essential part of the collaborative nature of open source.\n\n### Should I Read Up on Advanced Version Control Techniques?\nAbsolutely! Familiarizing yourself with advanced version control techniques, such as branching, merging, and rebasing, will significantly enhance your ability to contribute effectively. These skills will help you navigate the complexities of collaborative coding and ensure that your contributions are both valuable and efficient.\n\nIn conclusion, engaging with open source projects involves understanding their management, knowing how to submit patches, and being equipped with the right version control skills. Dive in and start contributing today!", "hard_negative_doc": "## Exploring Open Source Contributions\n\nWhat does it mean to contribute to open source projects? While many developers are eager to help, the process can be confusing. How are these projects typically run? What does it mean to submit changes? Also, is it necessary to learn about version control? \n\nWhile some people think that contributing is just about coding, it's also about understanding the community behind the project. However, many projects lack clear management structures, which can lead to chaos. Submitting a patch might just involve sending an email with your changes, but this isn't the best practice. \n\nAs for version control, many contributors manage just fine without diving into advanced techniques. Sometimes, a basic understanding is all you need to get started. So, while it's good to know about these tools, they aren't essential for everyone. \n\nIn summary, contributing to open source can be a mixed bag, and while there are some guidelines, they aren't always strictly followed.", "violated_attributes": ["format", "source"]}

Delegates are essentially type-safe function pointers that allow methods to be passed as parameters. In real-world applications, C# delegates are commonly used in event handling, where they enable a class to notify other classes or objects when an event occurs. For example, in a graphical user interface (GUI) application, a button click can trigger an event, and delegates allow the associated method to be executed in response to that click. Additionally, delegates can facilitate asynchronous programming, allowing you to execute tasks on different threads without blocking the main thread, thus improving application responsiveness.

This method has led to tightly coupled code, where reusable components are often duplicated across methods instead of being encapsulated within classes.\n\nRecently, I was tasked with updating a module I previously developed, which, while not perfectly loosely coupled, is better structured than much of our existing code.

While I can explain the fundamentals of testing, articulating its benefits in a way that resonates with my teammates proves challenging. Many of them associate testing with manual UI checks, leading to a misunderstanding of its true value.\n\nThe concept of loose coupling is foreign to my team, as evidenced by our current code structure, which lacks interfaces and modular design. I worry that advocating for these principles might confuse my colleagues rather than enlighten them. Additionally, I recognize that making significant changes, such as introducing an IoC container, could be perceived as unnecessary and a diversion from actual programming work.\n\nI’m reaching out to the developer community for advice on how to effectively advocate for the implementation of unit tests.

We usually just check if things work by clicking around in the UI, which seems fine. I mean, who needs tests when you can just see if the app runs?\n\nI recently had to tweak some code I wrote earlier, which was somewhat loosely coupled.

I don’t see the point in following TDD principles since the code is already there, and writing tests feels like a waste of time.\n\nWhen I check in my updates, I expect my teammates to ask about this new \"Tests\" project I’ve created. I can’t imagine they’ll understand why I’m spending so much time on it when we could just run the app ourselves. They probably think that testing means you have to do everything manually, which is how we’ve always done it.\n\nHonestly, I doubt they’ll grasp the idea of loose coupling or why it matters. I’d rather not confuse them with technical jargon. Introducing something like an IoC container would just be seen as me overcomplicating things.

This means that the database is completely independent of the model code, the model code does not interact with the controller code, and the controller code remains unaware of the view code. This separation could even extend to the hardware level and beyond, maintaining the same pattern of independence.\n\nWhen examining the flow of information, we can see that the view can be aware of the controller, but it should not have any knowledge of the model. Similarly, the controller can interact with the model but should not be aware of the underlying database. The model, in turn, can interact with the database while remaining ignorant of the operating system. This layered architecture ensures that each component can evolve independently, enhancing maintainability and scalability.\n\nYou might wonder, **why is this unidirectional style of layering a good idea?** The answer lies in the principles of software design that prioritize loose coupling and high cohesion. By ensuring that each layer only communicates with its immediate neighbor, we reduce the risk of changes in one layer impacting others, thus promoting a more robust and flexible application structure. This design philosophy not only simplifies debugging and testing but also allows developers to make changes and updates with confidence, knowing that other components remain unaffected.

This means that layers can easily influence one another, which might seem beneficial for rapid development. However, you might ask, **why is this layering style considered effective?** While some may argue that it allows for faster interactions and easier data access, it often leads to tighter coupling, making the system harder to maintain and scale over time.

The first approach suggests that the view layer should reference the business layer, the business layer should reference the data layer, and the data layer should be self-contained, knowing only about itself. 2. The second approach posits that the view layer references the business layer, the business layer is self-referential, and the data layer references the business layer. I've been implementing the second approach, utilizing Inversion of Control (IOC) within the business layer, but I feel hesitant to move forward without a deeper understanding of the implications.

The authors present a compelling example that critiques a common practice in controllers. They argue that using a line like this is problematic:\n\n```ruby\n@street = @invoice.customer.address.street\n```\n\nTheir suggested remedy is to refactor the code as follows:\n\n```ruby\nclass Customer\n  has_one :address\n  belongs_to :invoice\n\n  def street\n    address.street\n  end\nend\n\nclass Invoice\n  has_one :customer\n\n  def customer_street\n    customer.street\n  end\nend\n\n@street = @invoice.customer_street\n```\n\nThe reasoning behind this proposal is that by reducing the number of method calls to a single dot, we can avoid violating the Law of Demeter. However, I find this reasoning flawed. Despite the singular dot, we are still traversing through the `customer` to access the `address` and ultimately retrieve the street associated with the invoice.\n\nThis perspective echoes a blog post I encountered, which can be found here: [Dan Manges' Blog](http://www.dan-manges.com/blog/37). The author illustrates a similar scenario:\n\n```ruby\nclass Wallet\n  attr_accessor :cash\nend\n\nclass Customer\n  has_one :wallet\n\n  def cash\n    @wallet.cash\n  end\nend\n\nclass Paperboy\n  def collect_money(customer, due_amount)\n    if customer.cash < due_amount\n      raise InsufficientFundsError\n    else\n      customer.cash -= due_amount\n      @collected_amount += due_amount\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe blog post emphasizes that even though there’s only one dot in `customer.cash`, rather than `customer.wallet.cash`, this still constitutes a violation of the Law of Demeter. The Paperboy's `collect_money` method, for instance, utilizes a single dot, yet it still directly accesses the customer's wallet to withdraw cash. \n\nIn light of this, I fully acknowledge and concur that a better approach would involve creating a `withdraw` method within the `Wallet` class to manage payments. This method should then be called from within the `Customer` class. However, I remain perplexed about how my initial example could be deemed compliant when `Invoice` is still directly accessing `Customer` to obtain the street. \n\nI have been grappling with this concept for the past two days, and I would greatly appreciate any clarification on this topic, as it continues to be quite perplexing.", "hard_negative_doc": "### Misunderstanding the Law of Demeter\n\nI am currently exploring a book titled *Rails AntiPatterns*, which discusses delegation and its relation to the Law of Demeter.

However, I believe this interpretation is flawed. Even with this refactoring, we are still accessing the `address` through `customer`, which feels like a violation of the principle.\n\nI came across a blog post by Dan Manges that further illustrates this issue. In his example, he describes the following classes:\n\n```ruby\nclass Wallet\n  attr_accessor :cash\nend\n\nclass Customer\n  has_one :wallet\n\n  def cash\n    @wallet.cash\n  end\nend\n\nclass Paperboy\n  def collect_money(customer, due_amount)\n    if customer.cash < due_amount\n      raise InsufficientFundsError\n    else\n      customer.cash -= due_amount\n      @collected_amount += due_amount\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIn this case, even though we only see one dot in `customer.cash`, the blog post argues that this still violates the Law of Demeter. The Paperboy's `collect_money` method directly accesses the customer's wallet to retrieve cash, which is not ideal.\n\nThe author emphasizes that to truly adhere to the Law of Demeter, we should implement a `withdraw` method in the `Wallet` class to manage payments, and this method should be called within the `Customer` class instead. \n\nThis leads me to question whether my initial example still violates the Law of Demeter, as `Invoice` is effectively reaching into `Customer` to retrieve the street.

One such principle is the Law of Demeter, which advocates for minimal knowledge between components. A book that delves into this topic is 'Rails AntiPatterns'. It emphasizes the importance of delegation in avoiding violations of this law. \n\nFor instance, consider the following example, which the authors argue is problematic: \n\n```ruby\n@street = @invoice.customer.address.street\n``` \n\nThis line of code is seen as a violation because it traverses multiple objects to retrieve a single piece of information. The authors suggest a more compliant approach: \n\n```ruby\nclass Customer\n  has_one :address\n  belongs_to :invoice\n\n  def street\n    address.street\n  end\nend\n\nclass Invoice\n  has_one :customer\n\n  def customer_street\n    customer.street\n  end\nend\n\n@street = @invoice.customer_street\n``` \n\nIn this revised code, the delegation is reduced to a single method call, which the authors argue adheres to the Law of Demeter. However, I find this reasoning somewhat flawed. Even though there is only one dot in the method call `@invoice.customer_street`, we are still indirectly accessing the address through the customer. This leads me to question whether this truly resolves the issue of coupling. \n\nTo further illustrate this point, I came across a blog post by Dan Manges that provides another example: \n\n```ruby\nclass Wallet\n  attr_accessor :cash\nend\n\nclass Customer\n  has_one :wallet\n\n  def cash\n    @wallet.cash\n  end\nend\n\nclass Paperboy\n  def collect_money(customer, due_amount)\n    if customer.cash < due_amount\n      raise InsufficientFundsError\n    else\n      customer.cash -= due_amount\n      @collected_amount += due_amount\n    end\n  end\nend\n``` \n\nIn this scenario, the Paperboy's method `collect_money` accesses the customer's cash with a single dot, `customer.cash`. However, the blog post argues that this still violates the Law of Demeter because the Paperboy is directly accessing the customer's wallet to retrieve cash. \n\nThis raises an important question: does reducing the number of dots in method calls effectively solve the problem of coupling? I’ve been grappling with this concept for the past two days, and I would appreciate any insights or clarifications from fellow developers who might have faced similar confusion.", "hard_negative_doc": "I recently started reading a book titled 'Rails AntiPatterns', which discusses various coding practices, including delegation. One of the main points they make is that using direct object access can lead to breaking the Law of Demeter. For example, they mention that using the following code is not advisable: \n\n```ruby\n@street = @invoice.customer.address.street\n``` \n\nThey suggest a better alternative: \n\n```ruby\nclass Customer\n  has_one :address\n  belongs_to :invoice\n\n  def street\n    address.street\n  end\nend\n\nclass Invoice\n  has_one :customer\n\n  def customer_street\n    customer.street\n  end\nend\n\n@street = @invoice.customer_street\n``` \n\nThe reasoning here is that a single method call is better than multiple calls. However, I disagree because it still feels like you are accessing the address through the customer. I read a blog post that supports this view, where they use the following code: \n\n```ruby\nclass Wallet\n  attr_accessor :cash\nend\n\nclass Customer\n  has_one :wallet\n\n  def cash\n    @wallet.cash\n  end\nend\n\nclass Paperboy\n  def collect_money(customer, due_amount)\n    if customer.cash < due_amount\n      raise InsufficientFundsError\n    else\n      customer.cash -= due_amount\n      @collected_amount += due_amount\n    end\n  end\nend\n``` \n\nIn this case, the Paperboy accesses `customer.cash`, which is a single dot, but it still feels wrong because the Paperboy is digging into the customer's wallet.

This seems a bit over the top to me and has a bit of a code smell or anti pattern feel to it. For my example, I have two classes, WO and LabourStep. They have 4 classes for the same thing WO,WOHeader,Warranty,LabourStep. There will only ever be one WOHeader per WO and the same for Warranty. My one seems far simpler to manage changes (add a new property to WO and thats it), but is less human readable. On their side, The structure is a little more easier to read by a human, but it feel like its pushing a logical view onto the contract the doesn't really belong. And to add a new property potentially requires a modification to the WO and the creation of a new class if a new logical group was added. These extra classes are only there to group properties. What is the right way to go? ======EDIT========== Frank - I completely agree with your thoughts and it is the way I approach my development. Except in this case, the third party monolithic enterprise system we are integrating with has been written in a very generic way to try and cater for as many businesses as possible. The data is spread across three tables in a one to one mapping with the majority in one table. There is barely any validation. There is no concept of a \"Warranty\" object/thing in that system. Its just 3 properties against a WO. All the web service will do is act like a data store, with the WO persisted as a whole. e.g. getWO() updateWO() createWO(). There will never be get/updateWarranty() methods. It's all just one blob of data to read/persist. On our side, we never use the result directly from web services even if they are our own. We convert them into proper models and then use those. To us a data contract is very different to a model. There is no business logic in the data contract, its purely a container to get data from one part of the system to another without closely coupling them. That means we can easily change to persist to a database instead of a web service and all its needs to do is match the interface of the web service. This also allows us to modify our own models which may even include results from multiple web services without having to worry about being restricted to or changing the format of the data contracts. So when I think in those terms, Having the data contracts split into WOHeader or WOWarranty classes just doesn't make any sense. It will never used in that way, not even by them. Its just there for a nice logical group of properties that mean nothing by themselves. A region block around those properties would have the same net effect. Labour steps and equipment details however, make a lot of sense to be in separate classes as they are separate entities and not just properties of work orders.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Design", "Interface", "Data Structure"], "format": "Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Forum", "attributes": {"language": "English", "source": "Forum", "format": "Discussion"}, "combo_id": 1, "instructed_query": "In this English forum discussion, should the interface only be used for behavior and not to show logical data grouped together?", "reversed_query": "In this English forum discussion, should the interface not be used solely for behavior and should it also show logical data grouped together?", "query_type": "expanded", "positive_doc": "I am currently designing software that will integrate with our enterprise system via web services, specifically focusing on work orders necessary for equipment maintenance.

Their simplified version appears as follows: \n\n``` \nclass WO { \n    class WOHeader { \n        property Number; \n        property Description; \n    } \n    class Warranty { \n        property WarrantyStatus; \n        property WarrantySettlementDate; \n    } \n    list property LabourSteps<LabourStep>[]; \n    list property Children<WO>[]; \n} \n``` \n\nThis approach would result in approximately eight classes, each containing a few properties, which seems excessive to me and gives off a code smell or anti-pattern vibe. In my model, I utilize two classes: WO and LabourStep. They, however, have four classes for the same information: WO, WOHeader, Warranty, and LabourStep. Since there will only ever be one WOHeader and one Warranty per WO, my design appears simpler for managing changes—adding a new property to WO requires only one modification. However, their structure is arguably more human-readable. Yet, it feels like they are imposing a logical view onto the contract that may not be necessary. Adding a new property could necessitate altering the WO and creating a new class if a new logical group were introduced. These additional classes seem to exist solely to group properties. Which approach is correct? \n\n=====EDIT========== \nFrank, I completely align with your perspective, and it reflects my development approach. However, in this instance, the third-party monolithic enterprise system we are integrating with has been built generically to accommodate various businesses. The data is distributed across three tables with a one-to-one mapping, predominantly in one table, and lacks robust validation. There is no defined \"Warranty\" object in that system; it simply consists of three properties linked to a WO. The web service acts merely as a data store, persisting the WO as a whole (e.g., getWO(), updateWO(), createWO()). There will never be methods like get/updateWarranty(). It's all treated as a single blob of data for reading and persisting. On our end, we never directly utilize the results from web services, even if they are our own. We transform them into appropriate models before use. For us, a data contract significantly differs from a model; the data contract serves purely as a conduit to transfer data between system components without tightly coupling them. This flexibility allows us to switch to a database for persistence without altering the web service interface. It also enables us to modify our models, which may incorporate results from multiple web services, without being constrained by the data contract's format. Therefore, in this context, having the data contracts divided into WOHeader or WOWarranty classes seems illogical. They will not be utilized in that manner, not even by them.

A simplified version of their proposed structure is illustrated below: \n\nclass WO {\n    WOHeader class {\n        Number property;\n        Description property;\n    }\n    Warranty class {\n        WarrantyStatus property;\n        WarrantySettlementDate property;\n    }\n    LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] list property;\n    Children<WO>[] list property;\n}\n\nThis approach results in the creation of approximately eight classes in total, each containing a handful of properties. To me, this seems excessive and evokes a sense of code smell or an anti-pattern. In my model, there are only two classes: WO and LabourStep, whereas their model includes four classes for essentially the same functionality: WO, WOHeader, Warranty, and LabourStep. Given that there will only ever be a single WOHeader associated with each WO, as well as one Warranty, my design appears to be significantly simpler when it comes to managing changes. For instance, adding a new property to the WO class is straightforward, whereas their approach necessitates modifications to the WO class and the creation of an entirely new class should a new logical group be introduced. Although their structure may be marginally more human-readable, it seems to impose a logical framework onto the contract that may not be inherently appropriate. The additional classes exist solely to group properties, which raises the question: what is the optimal approach? \n\nUpon further reflection, I find myself in agreement with your perspective, as it aligns with my development methodology. However, in this specific scenario, we are interfacing with a third-party monolithic enterprise system that has been designed in a generic manner to accommodate a wide range of businesses. The data is distributed across three tables, maintaining a one-to-one mapping, with the majority of the information residing in a single table. Unfortunately, there is minimal validation present, and the concept of a 'Warranty' object is nonexistent within that system; it is merely represented as three properties associated with a work order. The web service will essentially function as a data repository, persisting the work order as a cohesive unit through methods such as getWO(), updateWO(), and createWO(). There will not be separate methods for retrieving or updating warranty information; it is all treated as a singular data blob for reading and persisting. \n\nOn our end, we do not directly utilize the results obtained from web services, even those we have developed ourselves. Instead, we convert these results into well-defined models for further use. For us, a data contract differs fundamentally from a model; the data contract serves purely as a conduit for transferring data between system components without fostering a tight coupling. This design philosophy allows us to pivot to database persistence if necessary, requiring only that the interface matches that of the web service. It also affords us the flexibility to modify our models, which may incorporate results from multiple web services, without being constrained by or needing to alter the format of the data contracts. Therefore, when I contemplate these considerations, it becomes evident that segmenting the data contracts into WOHeader or WOWarranty classes lacks rationale, as they will not be utilized in that manner—not even by the third party. These classes exist solely for the sake of providing a logical grouping of properties that are devoid of intrinsic meaning. In contrast, separating labour steps and equipment details into distinct classes is justifiable, as they represent separate entities rather than mere properties of work orders.", "hard_negative_doc": "I am currently working on a software project that integrates with our enterprise system using web services. We're focusing on work orders for equipment maintenance. However, there's a disagreement about the contract structure. I propose a single work order class with all properties, like so: \n\nclass WO {\n    Number;\n    Description;\n    WarrantyStatus;\n    WarrantySettlementDate;\n    LabourSteps<LabourStep>[];\n    Children<WO>[];\n}\n\nThe other side wants to create a work order class along with separate classes for each logical grouping. For example: \n\nclass WO {\n    WOHeader {\n        Number;\n        Description;\n    }\n    Warranty {\n        WarrantyStatus;\n        WarrantySettlementDate;\n    }\n    LabourSteps<LabourStep>[];\n    Children<WO>[];\n}\n\nThis results in about eight classes, which feels excessive. I have only two classes, while they have four for the same functionality. My approach allows for easier changes, but their structure is more readable. However, it seems to impose a logical view onto the contract that doesn't belong. Adding a new property on their side would require more modifications. \n\nIn this case, I understand your perspective, but the third-party system we are integrating with is very generic and has data spread across multiple tables. There is little validation, and no concept of a 'Warranty' object. The web service acts as a data store, persisting the work order as a whole. We don't use the results directly from web services; we convert them into models. A data contract is merely a container for data transfer, allowing us to change our models without worrying about the data contract format.

This seems a bit over the top to me and has a bit of a code smell or anti pattern feel to it. For my example, I have two classes, WO and LabourStep. They have 4 classes for the same thing WO,WOHeader,Warranty,LabourStep. There will only ever be one WOHeader per WO and the same for Warranty. My one seems far simpler to manage changes (add a new property to WO and thats it), but is less human readable. On their side, The structure is a little more easier to read by a human, but it feel like its pushing a logical view onto the contract the doesn't really belong. And to add a new property potentially requires a modification to the WO and the creation of a new class if a new logical group was added. These extra classes are only there to group properties. What is the right way to go? ======EDIT========== Frank - I completely agree with your thoughts and it is the way I approach my development. Except in this case, the third party monolithic enterprise system we are integrating with has been written in a very generic way to try and cater for as many businesses as possible. The data is spread across three tables in a one to one mapping with the majority in one table. There is barely any validation. There is no concept of a \"Warranty\" object/thing in that system. Its just 3 properties against a WO. All the web service will do is act like a data store, with the WO persisted as a whole. e.g. getWO() updateWO() createWO(). There will never be get/updateWarranty() methods. It's all just one blob of data to read/persist. On our side, we never use the result directly from web services even if they are our own. We convert them into proper models and then use those. To us a data contract is very different to a model. There is no business logic in the data contract, its purely a container to get data from one part of the system to another without closely coupling them. That means we can easily change to persist to a database instead of a web service and all its needs to do is match the interface of the web service. This also allows us to modify our own models which may even include results from multiple web services without having to worry about being restricted to or changing the format of the data contracts. So when I think in those terms, Having the data contracts split into WOHeader or WOWarranty classes just doesn't make any sense. It will never used in that way, not even by them. Its just there for a nice logical group of properties that mean nothing by themselves. A region block around those properties would have the same net effect. Labour steps and equipment details however, make a lot of sense to be in separate classes as they are separate entities and not just properties of work orders.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Design", "Interface", "Data Structure"], "format": "Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Forum", "attributes": {"format": "Discussion", "language": "English", "audience": "Software Developer"}, "combo_id": 5, "instructed_query": "In this discussion, I would like to explore whether the interface should only be used for behavior and not to show logical data grouped together, specifically aimed at software developers in English.", "reversed_query": "In this discussion, I would like to argue that the interface should not only be used for behavior but also to show logical data grouped together, specifically aimed at software developers in English.", "query_type": "expanded", "positive_doc": "I am currently working on a software design that integrates with our enterprise system through web services, specifically focusing on the management of work orders necessary for equipment maintenance.

Because the test to see if the loop should end is in the middle of a logical set of steps, the while loop itself currently doesn't check anything meaningful; the check is instead performed at the \"proper\" place within the conceptual algorithm. I was told that this is bad code, because it is more bug-prone due to the ending condition not being checked by the loop structure. It's more difficult to figure out how you'd exit the loop, and could invite bugs as the breaking condition might be bypassed or omitted accidentally given future changes. Now, the code could be structured as follows:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        TransformInSomeWay(input);             while(!ProcessingComplete(input))        {           DoSomethingElseTo(input);           TransformInSomeWay(input);        }     }      However, this duplicates a call to a method in code, violating DRY; if `TransformInSomeWay` were later replaced with some other method, both calls would have to be found and changed (and the fact that there are two may be less obvious in a more complex piece of code). You could also write it like:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        var complete = false;        while(!complete)        {           TransformInSomeWay(input);                complete = ProcessingComplete(input);                if(!complete)            {              DoSomethingElseTo(input);                     }        }     }      ... but you now have a variable whose only purpose is to shift the condition- checking to the loop structure, and also has to be checked multiple times to provide the same behavior as the original logic. For my part, I say that given the algorithm this code implements in the real world, the original code is the most readable. If you were going through it yourself, this is the way you'd think about it, and so it would be intuitive to people familiar with the algorithm. So, which is \"better\"? is it better to give the responsibility of condition checking to the while loop by structuring the logic around the loop? Or is it better to structure the logic in a \"natural\" way as indicated by requirements or a conceptual description of the algorithm, even though that may mean bypassing the loop's built-in capabilities?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Programming", "Python"], "format": "Code Example", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Programming Forum", "attributes": {"source": "Programming Forum", "language": "English"}, "combo_id": 1, "instructed_query": "Can someone explain the Python case statement in English on a Programming Forum?", "reversed_query": "Is there any discussion about the Python case statement not in English or outside of a Programming Forum?", "query_type": "expanded", "positive_doc": "Consider the following code: \n\n```java\npublic void doSomething(int input) { \n    while (true) { \n        TransformInSomeWay(input); \n        if (ProcessingComplete(input)) \n            break; \n        DoSomethingElseTo(input); \n    } \n}\n```\n\nAssume that this process involves a finite but input-dependent number of steps; the loop is designed to terminate on its own due to the algorithm, and is not intended to run indefinitely (unless interrupted by an external event). The check for whether the loop should end occurs at a logical point within the algorithm rather than being explicitly checked by the loop itself. Some argue that this is poor coding practice because it makes the code more prone to bugs, as the ending condition is not directly tied to the loop structure. This can complicate understanding how to exit the loop, and future changes might inadvertently bypass or omit the breaking condition.\n\nAn alternative structure could be:\n\n```java\npublic void doSomething(int input) { \n    TransformInSomeWay(input); \n    while (!ProcessingComplete(input)) { \n        DoSomethingElseTo(input); \n        TransformInSomeWay(input); \n    } \n}\n```\n\nHowever, this approach duplicates a method call, violating the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. If `TransformInSomeWay` were to be modified later, both instances would need to be updated, which could be less obvious in more complex code.\n\nAnother possible structure is:\n\n```java\npublic void doSomething(int input) { \n    var complete = false; \n    while (!complete) { \n        TransformInSomeWay(input); \n        complete = ProcessingComplete(input); \n        if (!complete) { \n            DoSomethingElseTo(input); \n        } \n    } \n}\n```\n\nIn this case, a variable is introduced solely to facilitate condition checking within the loop structure, which must be evaluated multiple times to achieve the same behavior as the original logic. From my perspective, considering the algorithm this code implements, the original version is more readable. It aligns with how one would naturally think about the process, making it intuitive for those familiar with the algorithm. So, which approach is superior?

In my opinion, considering the algorithm's real-world application, the original code is the most readable option. It aligns with how one would intuitively think about the process, making it easier for individuals familiar with the algorithm to follow. Thus, the question arises: which approach is superior? Should the responsibility for condition checking be assigned to the while loop by structuring the logic accordingly, or is it preferable to organize the logic in a manner that reflects the natural flow dictated by the algorithm's requirements, even if it means not fully utilizing the loop's inherent capabilities?", "hard_negative_doc": "Consider the following code snippet that illustrates a method designed to perform a series of operations based on an input parameter: \n\n```java\npublic void doSomething(int input) {\n    while (true) {\n        TransformInSomeWay(input);\n        DoSomethingElseTo(input);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we assume that the process involves an indefinite number of steps that depend on the input.
