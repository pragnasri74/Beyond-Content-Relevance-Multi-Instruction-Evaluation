Should I avoid private methods now?", "document": "I very often hear the following: \"If you want to test private methods, you'd better put that in another class and expose it.\" While sometimes that's the case and we have a hiding concept inside our class, other times you end up with classes that have the same attributes (or, worst, every attribute of one class become a argument on a method in the other class) and exposes functionality that is, in fact, implementation detail. Specially on TDD, when you **refactor** a class with public methods out of a previous tested class, that class is now part of your interface, but has no tests to it (since you refactored it, and is a implementation detail). Now, I may be not finding an obvious better answer, but if my answer is the \"correct\", that means that sometimes writting unit tests can break encapsulation, and divide the same responsibility into different classes. A simple example would be testing a setter method when a getter is not actually needed for anything in the real code. Please when aswering don't provide simple answers to specific cases I may have written. Rather, try to explain more of the generic case and theoretical approach. And this is neither language specific. Thanks in advance. **EDIT:** The answer given by Matthew Flynn was really insightful, but didn't quite answer the question. Altough he made the fair point that you either don't test private methods or extract them because they really are other concern and responsibility (or at least that was what I could understand from his answer), I think there are situations where unit testing private methods is useful. My primary example is when you have a class that has one responsibility but the output (or input) that it gives (takes) is just to complex. For example, a hashing function. There's no good way to break a hashing function apart and mantain cohesion and encapsulation. However, testing a hashing function can be really tough, since you would need to calculate by hand (you can't use code calculation to test code calculation!) the hashing, and test multiple cases where the hash changes. In that way (and this may be a question worth of its own topic) I think private method testing is the best way to handle it. Now, I'm not sure if I should ask another question, or ask it here, but are there any better way to test such complex output (input)? OBS: Please, if you think I should ask another question on that topic, leave a comment. :) **EDIT2:** I accepted a answer as my correct because it made me think and decide my course of action, altough it didn't answered my queston completely. But for those who face the same problem as I do (one cohesive class that will change together, but is still too hard to test by itsfelf), I'll tell what I did and why. I decided that the output of that class is simply too hard to a computer to test correctly, so I didn't test it. I could have used a framework to test it's private methods (which would be the best idea, I think), but I didn't want to get to that point. If you are wondering what it is that is cohesive and respects SRP, and still is too hard to a computer to test, I'll give some examples: heightmap generation, hashing functions, procedural music generation (you can test some units, but the highest level unit is simply too subjective).", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Software Development", "Testing", "TDD"], "format": "Forum Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "StackOverflow", "instructed_query": "As a developer new to TDD, should I avoid private methods now?

I soon found out we have such different mindsets when it comes to our \"mother programming tongue\" that it risks not only the good delivery of the project but also the general well-being of the team/office. Specifically: They come from an electrical engineering/automation/polytechnic type of background, so their reasoning is intimately related to how hardware works, how bytes move around, processor workings, instruction caching, generally everything at the lower layers. They did embedded programming, ARM programming (I barely know what those are). I soon found out their practical experience is with mostly C, not C++. They think procedurally, not OOP. I, on the other hand, have trained myself to think in a more abstract way, to apply principles such as encapsulation, low coupling/high cohesion for creating reusable, modular software. My speciality is the C++ programming language, with an accent on language constructs that help you get both fast and reusable, generic code. I think design patterns, idioms, concepts. Throughout 9 years of developing software I consistently witnessed how poor maintainability of software systems is by far the #1 burden of teams. I generously document my code, write careful interfaces. I embrace template meta-programming as a way to obtain fast and reusable products. I embrace the new C++11 standard features. Where I see reusability and loose coupling, they see \"complication\". They want to \"see it all there\". They want to see `char*`, not some buffer class in interface methods. At one point one even said \"I don't care how simple your interfaces are if your implementation looks complicated\". The trouble is, we really are trying to transition from a monolithic style of systems to a reusable one - we are writing a library. Yet they don't wish to see their C-style structs being polluted with templated methods, typedefs and c-tors, even if neither makes their structs non-POD. They also don't wish to see static_assert(std::is_pod<...>). They love memcpy and pointers and generally stay away from references. They tend to think typedefs are somehow evil. I really tried to make them see an abstraction for what it is. It is code together with data it operates on. By necessity, a library needs to define some interfaces for the user to be able to plug it into a larger product. They tend to see these interfaces as ways in which my code _requires their code behave/look as I wish and doesn't allow them to do things their way_ , but without actually telling me a specific functionality they can't obtain. Make no mistake, I'm no ignorant when it comes to performance. I know about cache lines, branch prediction, the overhead of method virtualization, heap allocation, hash lookups. I'm good with complexity of algorithms (though that doesn't matter so much here), data structures, inlining and some other compiler optimizations such as RVO. I believe with a modern compiler a reusable, layered OOP C++ product can get within 10% of the performance of a C-only monolithic product, when carefully written and optimized. I honestly believed we would complement each other in our thinking. What are your thoughts?

This violates encapsulation. Only the object itself should care about its internal state. And an example Procedural version of code.               struct Fridge     {         int cheese;     }          void go_shopping(Fridge fridge)     {          fridge.cheese += 5;     }      Mutator version of code:               class Fridge     {          int cheese;               void set_cheese(int _cheese) { cheese = _cheese; }          int get_cheese() { return cheese; }      }          void go_shopping(Fridge fridge)     {          fridge.set_cheese(fridge.get_cheese() + 5);             }      The getters and setters made the code much more complicated without affording proper encapsulation.

ETL processes are a key component of DWs because incorrect or misleading data will produce wrong business decisions, and therefore, a correct design of these processes at early stages of a DW project is absolutely necessary to improve data quality. However, not much research has dealt with the modeling of ETL processes. In this paper, we present our approach, based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which allows us to accomplish the conceptual modeling of these ETL processes together with the conceptual schema of the target DW in an integrated manner. We provide the necessary mechanisms for an easy and quick specification of the common operations defined in these ETL processes such as, the integration of different data sources, the transformation between source and target attributes, the generation of surrogate keys and so on. Moreover, our approach allows the designer a comprehensive tracking and documentation of entire ETL processes, which enormously facilitates the maintenance of these processes. Another advantage of our proposal is the use of the UML (standardization, ease-of-use and functionality) and the seamless integration of the design of the ETL processes with the DW conceptual schema.

With technological advance on microelectronic and vision system, high performance automatic techniques on biometric recognition are now becoming economically feasible. Among all the biometric identification methods, face recognition has attracted much attention in recent years because it has potential to be most nonintrusive and user-friendly. The PDBNN face recognition system consists of three modules: First, a face detector finds the location of a human face in an image. Then an eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes in order to generate meaningful feature vectors. The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes, and nose, but excluding mouth (eye-glasses will be allowed). Lastly, the third module is a face recognizer. The PDBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules. It adopts a hierarchical network structures with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. The paper demonstrates a successful application of PDBNN to face recognition applications on two public (FERET and ORL) and one in-house (SCR) databases. Regarding the performance, experimental results on three different databases such as recognition accuracies as well as false rejection and false acceptance rates are elaborated. As to the processing speed, the whole recognition process (including PDBNN processing for eye localization, feature extraction, and classification) consumes approximately one second on Sparc10, without using hardware accelerator or co-processor.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Face Recognition", "Biometrics"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss Face Detection Using Quantized Skin Color Regions Merging and Wavelet Packet Analysis in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Face Recognition", "Image Processing"], "format": "Research Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Academic Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss the topic of face detection using quantized skin color regions merging and wavelet packet analysis.

Recent advances in information acquisition and processing technologies have allowed online vendors to offer varieties of web-based personalization that not only increases switching costs, but also serves as important means of acquiring valuable customer information. However, investments in online personalization may be severely undermined if consumers do not use these services due to privacy concerns. In the absence of any empirical evidence that seeks to understand this consumer dilemma, our research develops a parsimonious model to predict consumers’ usage of online personalization as a result of the tradeoff between their value for personalization and concern for privacy. In addition to this tradeoff, we find that a consumer’s intent to use personalization services is positively influenced by her trust in the vendor. Our findings suggest that: 1. online vendors can improve their abilities to acquire and use customer information through trust building activities; 2. it is of critical importance that vendors understand and evaluate the different values consumers may place in enjoying various types of personalization.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Marketing", "Consumer Behavior", "Privacy"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss the findings of the experiment titled 'When 25 Cents is Too Much: An Experiment on Willingness-To-Sell and Willingness-To-Protect Personal Information'.

HSI data often lie on sparse, nonlinear manifolds whose geometric and topological structures can be exploited via manifold-learning techniques. In this article, we focused on demonstrating the opportunities provided by manifold learning for classification of remotely sensed data. However, limitations and opportunities remain both for research and applications. Although these methods have been demonstrated to mitigate the impact of physical effects that affect electromagnetic energy traversing the atmosphere and reflecting from a target, nonlinearities are not always exhibited in the data, particularly at lower spatial resolutions, so users should always evaluate the inherent nonlinearity in the data. Manifold learning is data driven, and as such, results are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the data, and one method will not consistently provide the best results. Nonlinear manifold-learning methods require parameter tuning, although experimental results are typically stable over a range of values, and have higher computational overhead than linear methods, which is particularly relevant for large-scale remote sensing data sets. Opportunities for advancing manifold learning also exist for analysis of hyperspectral and multisource remotely sensed data. Manifolds are assumed to be inherently smooth, an assumption that some data sets may violate, and data often contain classes whose spectra are distinctly different, resulting in multiple manifolds or submanifolds that cannot be readily integrated with a single manifold representation. Developing appropriate characterizations that exploit the unique characteristics of these submanifolds for a particular data set is an open research problem for which hierarchical manifold structures appear to have merit. To date, most work in manifold learning has focused on feature extraction from single images, assuming stationarity across the scene. Research is also needed in joint exploitation of global and local embedding methods in dynamic, multitemporal environments and integration with semisupervised and active learning.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Remote Sensing", "Hyperspectral Imaging", "Machine Learning"], "format": "Journal Article", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Scientific Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss Active-Metric Learning for Classification of Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Images.

This overfitting is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random “dropout” gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition. A feedforward, artificial neural network uses layers of non-linear hidden units between its inputs and its outputs. By adapting the weights on the incoming connections of these hidden units it learns feature detectors that enable it to predict the correct output when given an input vector [15]. If the relationship between the input and the correct output is complicated and the network has enough hidden units to model it accurately, there will typically be many different settings of the weights that can model the training set almost perfectly, especially if there is only a limited amount of labeled training data. Each of these weight vectors will make different predictions on held-out test data and almost all of them will do worse on the test data than on the training data because the feature detectors have been tuned to work well together on the training data but not on the test data. Overfitting can be reduced by using “dropout” to prevent complex co-adaptations on the training data. On each presentation of each training case, each hidden unit is randomly omitted from the network with a probability of 0.5, so a hidden unit cannot rely on other hidden units being present. Another way to view the dropout procedure is as a very efficient way of performing model averaging with neural networks. A good way to reduce the error on the test set is to average the predictions produced by a very large number of different networks. The standard way to do this is to train many separate networks and then to apply each of these networks to the test data, but this is computationally expensive during both training and testing. Random dropout makes it possible to train a huge number of different networks in a reasonable time. There is almost certainly a different network for each presentation of each training case but all of these networks share the same weights for the hidden units that are present. We use the standard, stochastic gradient descent procedure for training the dropout neural networks on mini-batches of training cases, but we modify the penalty term that is normally used to prevent the weights from growing too large. Instead of penalizing the squared length (L2 norm) of the whole weight vector, we set an upper bound on the L2 norm of the incoming weight vector for each individual hidden unit. If a weight-update violates this constraint, we renormalize the weights of the hidden unit by division. Using a constraint rather than a penalty prevents weights from growing very large no matter how large the proposed weight-update is.

This paper explores the application of Bacterial Foraging Optimization to the problem of mobile robot navigation to determine shortest feasible path to move from any current position to target position in unknown environment with moving obstacles. It develops a new algorithm based on Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) technique. This algorithm finds a path towards the target and avoiding the obstacles using particles which are randomly distributed on a circle around a robot. The criterion on which it selects the best particle is the distance to target and the Gaussian cost function of the particle. Then, a high level decision strategy is used for the selection and thus proceeds for the result. It works on local environment by using a simple robot sensor. So, it is free from having generated additional map which adds cost. Furthermore, it can be implemented without requirement to tuning algorithm and complex calculation. To simulate the algorithm, the program is written in C language and the environment is created by OpenGL. To test the efficiency of proposed technique, results are compared with Basic Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) and another well-known algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). From the experimental result it can be told that the proposed method gives better path or optimal path.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Robotics", "Optimization", "Algorithms"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss path planning through the PSO algorithm in complex environments.

Moreover, a followup investigation of the non-English servers suggests that nearly a third contain some useful cross-language data, such as parallel English on the page or links to parallel English pages the follow-up also found pages in five languages not identified by the Babel study (Catalan, Chinese, Hungarian, Icelandic, and Arabic; Michael Littman, personal communication). Given the continued explosive increase in the size of the Web, the trend toward business organizations that cross national boundaries, and high levels of competition for consumers in a global marketplace, it seems impossible not to view multilingual content on the Web as an expanding resource. Moreover, it is a dynamic resource, changing in content as the world changes. For example, Diekema et al., in a presentation at the 1998 TREC-7 conference (Voorhees and Harman, 1998), observed that the performance of their cross-language information retrieval was hurt by lexical gaps such as Bosnia/Bosniethis illustrates a highly topical missing pair in their static lexical resource (which was based on WordNet 1.5). And Gey et al., also at TREC-7, observed that in doing cross-language retrieval using commercial machine translation systems, gaps in the lexicon (their example was acupuncture/Akupunktur) could make the difference between precision of 0.08 and precision of 0.83 on individual queries. ttesnik (1998) presented an algorithm called", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Machine Translation", "Natural Language Processing"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Conference Proceedings", "instructed_query": "Discuss the improved statistical machine translation using monolingually-derived paraphrases.

Since developing this standard, the Joint Video Team of the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has also standardized an extension of that technology that is referred to as multiview video coding (MVC). MVC provides a compact representation for multiple views of a video scene, such as multiple synchronized video cameras. Stereo-paired video for 3-D viewing is an important special case of MVC. The standard enables inter-view prediction to improve compression capability, as well as supporting ordinary temporal and spatial prediction. It also supports backward compatibility with existing legacy systems by structuring the MVC bitstream to include a compatible “base view.” Each other view is encoded at the same picture resolution as the base view. In recognition of its high-quality encoding capability and support for backward compatibility, the stereo high profile of the MVC extension was selected by the Blu-Ray Disc Association as the coding format for 3-D video with high-definition resolution. This paper provides an overview of the algorithmic design used for extending H.264/MPEG-4 AVC towards MVC. The basic approach of MVC for enabling inter-view prediction and view scalability in the context of H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is reviewed. Related supplemental enhancement information (SEI) metadata is also described. Various “frame compatible” approaches for support of stereo-view video as an alternative to MVC are also discussed.

The ability to gather relevant information in real time is key to leveraging the value of the IoT as such information will be transformed into intelligence, which will facilitate the creation of an intelligent environment. Ultimately, the quality of the information gathered depends on how smart the devices are. In addition, these communicating devices will operate with different networking standards, may experience intermittent connectivity with each other, and many of them will be resource constrained. These characteristics open up several networking challenges that traditional routing protocols cannot solve. Consequently, devices will require intelligent routing protocols in order to achieve intelligent D2D communication.

Specifically, as hand-held devices are carried by human beings, we leverage two key social phenomena, namely social trust and social reciprocity, to promote efficient cooperation among devices. With this insight, we develop a coalitional game theoretic framework to devise social-tie based cooperation strategies for device-to-device communications. We also develop a network assisted relay selection mechanism to implement the coalitional game solution, and show that the mechanism is immune to group deviations, individually rational, and truthful. We evaluate the performance of the mechanism by using real social data traces.

We generate a dungeon composed of rooms, corridors, heroes, monsters and loot. Our world is effectively an object graph of structures and their relationships. As things change our representation of the world is amended to reflect those changes. Our hero kills a rat, picks up a shortsword, etc. To me the world (current reality) carries this idea of state and I'm missing how FP overcomes this. As our hero takes action, functions amend the state of the world. It appears to be every decision (AI or human) needs to be based on the state of the world as it is in the present. Where would we allow for concurrency? We can't have multiple processes concurrently ammending the state of the world lest one process base its outcomes on some expired state. It feels to me that all control should occur within a single control loop so that we're always processing the present state represented by our current object graph of the world. Clearly there are situations perfectly suited for concurrency (i.e. When processing isolated tasks whose states are independent of one another).

Deviceto- device (D2D) communications is a promising technique to provide wireless peer-to-peer services and enhance spectrum utilization in the LTE-Advanced networks. In D2D communications, the user equipments (UEs) are allowed to directly communicate between each other by reusing the cellular resources rather than using uplink and downlink resources in the cellular mode when communicating via the base station. However, enabling D2D communications in a cellular network poses two major challenges. First, the interference caused to the cellular users by D2D devices could critically affect the performances of the cellular devices. Second, the minimum quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of D2D communications need to be guaranteed. In this article, we introduce a novel resource allocation scheme (i.e. joint resource block scheduling and power control) for D2D communications in LTE-Advanced networks to maximize the spectrum utilization while addressing the above challenges. First, an overview of LTE-Advanced networks, and architecture and signaling support for provisioning of D2D communications in these networks are described. Furthermore, research issues and the current state-of-the-art of D2D communications are discussed. Then, a resource allocation scheme based on a column generation method is proposed for D2D communications. The objective is to maximize the spectrum utilization by finding the minimum transmission length in terms of time slots for D2D links while protecting the cellular users from harmful interference and guaranteeing the QoS of D2D links.

My impression is that projects using a DI framework like Spring or Guice tend to lose their object orientation and degenerate to a purely procedural design:   1. DI not only centralizes the question of which implementation of an object to use but also manages the life-cycle of these objects. Many OO **design patterns** , however, rely on the ability of business logic to wire objects. I wouldn't know, for example, how to implement a Strategy Pattern in Spring because the decision which of the concrete strategies to use, is statically determined by the configuration of the application instead of a piece of code. Same goes for decorator, composite, observer, ...   2. The reason above leads to a design where functionality and data are separated. Because you don't want to let the DI container decide when data is created, you split any code off the data in order to have only this part managed by the DI container. This is contrary to the idea of OO where **code and data should reside together** in one unit. This breaks the **encapsulation of data** because all fields of the data \"beans\" are exposed by public getters and setters.   3. You can't use **polymorphism** anymore because code is not linked to its data anymore and the \"virtual functions\" can't work. This leads to those instanceof cascades that we all know we shouldn't use. Also, we lose all those designs that rely on polymorphism.   4. The DI container will inject managed beans only in objects which are also managed by it. So you can't **mix managed beans and normal objects** because there can't be any \"non-managed gaps\" in the reference chain of managed beans. So once you started with DI, you need to put all other code under the control of the DI container and you can't use normal objects anymore. I suppose that this is the reason why the separation of code and data is done so rigorously in DI projects. I see that there are reasons why to use DI but is it really worth giving up so much? Don't people care about OO? Apart from this **article** , I can't find any discussions on this topic. Or is it just me who doesn't understand how to do this properly? Any ideas how the four points above can be tackled with? **Appendix 1: Explanation of strategy pattern** I refer to the example here. Let's assume there's a DI version of it where all implementations of `Strategy` and the `Context` are injected to `StrategyExample`. Then `StrategyExample` doesn't decide anymore which `Strategy` to inject into `Context` but the configuration would have already decided which implementation to inject into `Context`. So yes, DI heavily applies the Strategy Pattern. But it always does so statically.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Engineering", "Design Patterns"], "format": "Forum Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "StackOverflow", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Does 'Inversion of Control' promote 'Anemic Domain Model'?

Due to changed requirements, I have been asked to modify a module I previously wrote and that is fairly loosely coupled (not as much as I would like, but as best I can get without having to introduce a lot of other concepts). I've decided to include a suite of unit tests with my revised code to \"prove\" that it works as expected and demonstrate how testing works; I'm not following true TDD as some of the code is already written but I'm hoping to follow some TDD concepts for the new code I'll have to create. Now, inevitably I'm sure I'll be asked why it's taking me more than a day or two to write the code, since parts of what I'll be interacting with already exist in the system (albeit without any tests and very tightly coupled), and when I check the code in I'll be asked just what this \"Tests\" project is. I can explain the basics of testing, but I can't explain the actual benefits in a way the others would understand (because they think testing requires you to run the app yourself, since often the actual UI matters in determining if the feature \"works\" or not). They don't understand the idea of loose coupling (clearly evident by the fact nothing is loosely coupled; there aren't even any interfaces outside of the code I've written), so trying to use that as a benefit would probably earn me a \"Huh?\" kind of look, and again I can't be as loose as I would like to without having to rework several existing modules and probably introduce some kind of IoC container, which would be viewed as wasting time and not \"programming\".

The types of applications I am developing always have a custom aspect to them. So there will always be some code written which is client specific for every project. The method we are using now is as follows: Several 'CORE' projects exist in isolation from one another, each core project is a class library which is capable of running on its own, or with dependencies on other core modules. All of these core modules are documented (Sandcastle) and NuGet packages created for them, which are served up via a private NuGet feed. When a customer purchases the software we create a customer specific project which implements the bespoke code that they require, and pulls in the NuGet packages from the core libs as needed. The build of this project is what is provided to the customer, and each customer project has it's own Git repository. This has worked fine for a year or so, but I feel that as we add features to the core libraries the number of nuget packages is growing quite quickly. Is there a better method of organising code, whilst making sure there are not seperate version of the same code lying around? I know in this stackoverflow post it states that: > Google manages to keep the source code of all its projects, over 2000, in a > single code trunk containing hundreds of millions of code lines, with more > than 5,000 developers accessing the same repository. But this seems like it produce problems for us, due to having bespoke deployments. Any ideas or comments on what I am doing wrong? ## Edit The problems I foresee going with the google way are mainly to do with release management and build issues. We use continuous integration, so that every commit a build will be triggered and test automatically run. If we use one all encompassing repo I am not sure what effect this will have on the build and test servers. Will it have to build every customers project? Or would there be a branch per customer?

I am also extremely familiar with openssl command line tools. However, I have very little experience with web based PKI enabled projects & hence I am trying to design and code a personal project for understanding this better. ## The requirements This is the website for a bank. All Internet Banking users are allowed use any certificate issued by a few known CAs (verisign, Thawte, entrust etc). The Bank is not responsible for procuring certificates for the user. These certificates will be used for authentication to the banks website either instead of or as an add-on to username/password login. The platforms/OS etc are still not fixed. Assume that enrollment has been done - i.e. bank knows the certificate going to be used by each user. ## Design I was wondering what's the best way to do authentication?   1. I saw that Apache has a way to enable 2 way ssl - in this case, i think navigating to the website would automatically ask for a cert from the user. But I am not sure if this is enough because it seems that all it verifies is whether a certificate is signed by a trusted CA & also may be whether it falls in a white list of subject lines of the certificates etc. But this is not enough for a bank case because you need to be able to associate a bankuserid with a certificate.   2. IIS seems to have a way by which I can have a certificate stored for each user in Active Directory. This is what I understood from reading few MSDN articles. You turn on 2 way SSL in IIS & then when the user tries to navigate to the website, IIS will send a request to the browser with a list of approved CAs and browser will let the user pick an appropriate certificate from his certstore and sends it to backend. I am assuming that IIS will do 2 things     * Ensure that the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by under the cover negotiations)     * Based on the AD User-Cert Mapping, IIS will report the username to the application.   3. Do the authentication explicity by calling crypto functions rather depending on depending on the webserver to do it.     * Show a user screen where he uploads a certificate and the application ensures the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by asking the front-end to sign some string using the cert).     * The application has a database some of data is stored which allows each user to be mapped to his userid. This may be      * the whole cert corresponding to each userid     * the CA and cert serial number corresponding to each user id. I was wondering which is the commonly used method?

Both teams are located in India. I am on the west coast of the U.S. I'm finding leading remote teams challenging: First, their command of the English language is weak. Second, I'm having difficultly understanding them through their accents. Third is timing, we are 12 hours apart. We use Skype to communicate. I have a month to get the project done. We've burned through a week just setting up the environments. At this point I'm considering working their hours, 11p PDT to 7a PDT, to get them up to speed, so that I can get the project off the ground. A 12 hour lag time is too much. I'm looking for steps I can take to be successful at leading an offshore team. **Update** The offshore team's primary task is coding, of course, most coding tasks do involve some design work. The offshore team's are composed of one lead, 2 mid level (4 to 5 years) developers and a junior (~2 years) developer. The project is classic waterfall. We've handed the offshore team a business and a technical design document. We are trying to manage the offshore in an agile way. We have daily conference calls with them and I'm requiring the teams to send me a daily scrum in the form of an email answering the following questions:   1. What did I do today?   2. What am I going to do tomorrow?   3. What do I need from Chuck so I can do my job tomorrow? There is some ambiguity in the tasks. The intent was to give them enough direction for them to develop the task with out writing the code for them. I don't have a travel budget. I am using Fogbugz to track the tasks. Each task has been entered into Fogbugz and given a priority. Each team member has access to FogBugz and can choose what task they wish to complete. _Related question_ : What can we do to improve the way outsourcing/offshoring works? **Update 2** I've decided that I can not talk to the team once a day. I must work with them. Starting tonight I've started working the same hours they are. This makes me available to them when they have questions. It also allows me to gain their trust and respect. **Update 3** The project was completed and delivered on time. The key factor was me working the same time as the offshore team. If that had not occurred I'm confident we would have failed. I managed two offshore teams. One of the teams under preformed and I fired them taking on the work myself. Things that lead to success was: Communication, understand their culture and how they communicate. Build rapport with them. A couple of the workers I keep in touch a year after the project completed. Meetings, we met at the beginning of their day so any questions or blocked tasks could be addressed. At the end of the day a daily summary was send out by the worker describing their day and if they encountered any issues. Ideally we could resolve their issues by the start of their next day. Questions, ask questions. Most cases information is not volunteered. Be visible. Being online, available and reachable help fostered the team's commitment to the project. I was not just the daily email. Make it easy. Internally we had a complex QA system in which bugs where tracked. It was complex and hard to use. I paid the $$ for a fogbugz account for each of the team members. Most of the team had used FogBugz and understood the workflow.

Next week i'll be interviewing some contractors for a 6-month senior Dev position on a project. I'm an OK programmer myself, but nothing special, and at the moment i'm struggling to think of what questions to ask them, or what coding challenges i'd set, since the answers would likely go over my head anyway. The project is an ASP.NET MVC application for an intranet. My personal thought was to have them write a trivial MVC app that pulls some data from a DB during the interview, showing that they can implement a testable, loosely coupled application, but i don't know if this is _too_ trivial. From it i would expect them to have implemented a couple of tests, set up dependency injection, and probably use a repository instead of fat controllers. Any ideas, or is what i'm suggesting a bad idea? The coding part of the interview would likely last about 40 minutes. I timed myself doing what i'd planned and it took me just over half an hour. The candidates would have seen the requirements for the application a couple of days prior to the interview. From thinking about it a bit more, perhaps i should start off with a tightly coupled app, and ask the candidates to refactor it instead, and implement some tests?

Here is their prime example: They believe that calling something like this in the controller is bad (and I agree)               @street = @invoice.customer.address.street      Their proposed solution is to do the following:               class Customer              has_one :address         belongs_to :invoice              def street             address.street         end     end          class Invoice              has_one :customer              def customer_street             customer.street         end     end          @street = @invoice.customer_street      They are stating that since you only use one dot, you are not breaking the Law of Demeter here. I think this is incorrect, because you are still going through customer to go through address to get the invoice's street. I primarily got this idea from a blog post I read: http://www.dan-manges.com/blog/37 In the blog post the prime example is               class Wallet       attr_accessor :cash     end     class Customer       has_one :wallet            # attribute delegation       def cash         @wallet.cash       end     end          class Paperboy       def collect_money(customer, due_amount)         if customer.cash < due_ammount           raise InsufficientFundsError         else           customer.cash -= due_amount           @collected_amount += due_amount         end       end     end      The blog post states that although there is only one dot `customer.cash` instead of `customer.wallet.cash`, this code still violates the Law of Demeter. > Now in the Paperboy collect_money method, we don't have two dots, we just > have one in \"customer.cash\". Has this delegation solved our problem? Not at > all. If we look at the behavior, a paperboy is still reaching directly into > a customer's wallet to get cash out. EDIT I completely understand and agree that this is still a violation and I need to create a method in `Wallet` called withdraw that handles the payment for me and that I should call that method inside the `Customer` class. What I don't get is that according to this process, my first example still violates the Law of Demeter because `Invoice` is still reaching directly into `Customer` to get the street.

I am 14 and have been studying programming for 4 months now (3 months Python, 1 Month of Ruby). I haven't been pushed by my parents to do it, I took it up on my own. Whenever I try to show something I made to my dad, he says he finds no value in it. At first, I wrote simple text games, like a text version of rock paper scissors, roulette, blackjack, etc. When that got too easy, I tried to make them as advanced as possible. I made a roulette game in Ruby based off `instance_eval` and `method_missing`. I showed them to him, and he said that was \"childish\" to make games. After games got too easy, I have started extending the features of the languages, I made a module for a \"Changeable Range\" in Python, where one could just write:               j = crange.CRange(5)      then               j.shift(10)      to shift the start and stop up ten and               j.reverse()      to create a reversed range.

It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of γ-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure. Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation. In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Image Processing"], "format": "Academic Article", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss the methods of using contours to detect and localize junctions in natural images.

Theorems are reviewed that estimate local Lipschitz exponents of functions from the evolution across scales of their wavelet transform. It is then proven that the local maxima of the wavelet transform modulus detect the locations of irregular structures and provide numerical procedures to compute their Lipschitz exponents. The wavelet transform of singularities with fast oscillations have a particular behavior that is studied separately. The local frequency of such oscillations are measured from the wavelet transform modulus maxima. It has been shown numerically that oneand two-dimensional signals can be reconstructed, with a good approximation, from the local maxima of their wavelet transform modulus. As an application, an algorithm is developed that removes white noises from signals by analyzing the evolution of the wavelet transform maxima across scales. In two-dimensions, the wavelet transform maxima indicate the location of edges in images.

Additionally, the development of a new, noncontact, capacitive electrode that utilizes a custom integrated, high-impedance analog front-end is introduced. Offline tests on 10 subjects characterize the signal quality from the different electrodes and demonstrate that acquisition of small amplitude, SSVEP signals is possible, even through hair using the new integrated noncontact sensor. Online BCI experiments demonstrate that the information transfer rate (ITR) with the dry electrodes is comparable to that of wet electrodes, completely without the need for gel or other conductive media. In addition, data from the noncontact electrode, operating on the top of hair, show a maximum ITR in excess of 19 bits/min at 100% accuracy (versus 29.2 bits/min for wet electrodes and 34.4 bits/min for dry electrodes), a level that has never been demonstrated before.

Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections, measure economic indicators, and so on. Recently, social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large scale visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics, such as those in image tweets, so that prediction of sentiment from visual content is complementary to textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the needs in leveraging large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of image sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We first design a suitable CNN architecture for image sentiment analysis. We obtain half a million training samples by using a baseline sentiment algorithm to label Flickr images. To make use of such noisy machine labeled data, we employ a progressive strategy to fine-tune the deep network. Furthermore, we improve the performance on Twitter images by inducing domain transfer with a small number of manually labeled Twitter images. We have conducted extensive experiments on manually labeled Twitter images. The results show that the proposed CNN can achieve better performance in image sentiment analysis than competing algorithms.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Sentiment Analysis", "Social Media", "Image Processing"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss EmoBGM: estimating sound's emotion for creating slideshows with suitable BGM.

Although several approaches have been proposed to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions or speech, relatively limited work has been done to fuse these two, and other, modalities to improve the accuracy and robustness of the emotion recognition system. This paper analyzes the strengths and the limitations of systems based only on facial expressions or acoustic information. It also discusses two approaches used to fuse these two modalities: decision level and feature level integration. Using a database recorded from an actress, four emotions were classified: sadness, anger, happiness, and neutral state.

Our protocol consists of a preprocessing phase that is both independent of the function to be computed and of the inputs, and a much more efficient online phase where the actual computation takes place. The online phase is unconditionally secure and has total computational (and communication) complexity linear in n, the number of players, where earlier work was quadratic in n. Moreover, the work done by each player is only a small constant factor larger than what one would need to compute the circuit in the clear. We show this is optimal for computation in large fields. In practice, for 3 players, a secure 64-bit multiplication can be done in 0.05 ms. Our preprocessing is based on a somewhat homomorphic cryptosystem. We extend a scheme by Brakerski et al., so that we can perform distributed decryption and handle many values in parallel in one ciphertext. The computational complexity of our preprocessing phase is dominated by the public-key operations, we need O(n/s) operations per secure multiplication where s is a parameter that increases with the security parameter of the cryptosystem.

Although many ciphersuites are now well-understood in isolation, their composition remains problematic, and yet it is critical to obtain practical security guarantees for TLS. We experimentally confirm that all mainstream implementations of TLS share key materials between different algorithms, some of them of dubious strength. We outline attacks in their handling of resumption and renegotiation, stressing the need to model multiple related instances of the handshake. We study the provable security of the TLS handshake, as it is implemented and deployed. To capture the details of the standard and its main extensions, we rely on miTLS, a verified reference implementation of the protocol. miTLS inter-operates with mainstream browsers and servers for many protocol versions, configurations, and ciphersuites; and it provides application-level, provable security for some. We propose new agile security definitions and assumptions for the signatures, key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM), and key derivation algorithms used by the TLS handshake. By necessity, our definitions are stronger than those expected with simple modern protocols. To validate our model of key encapsulation, we prove that both RSA and Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites satisfy our definition for the KEM. In particular, we formalize the use of PKCS#1v1.5 encryption in TLS, including recommended countermeasures against Bleichenbacher attacks, and build a 3,000-line EasyCrypt proof of the security of the resulting master secret KEM against replayable chosen-ciphertext attacks under the assumption that ciphertexts are hard to re-randomize. Based on our new agile definitions, we construct a modular proof of security for the miTLS reference implementation of the handshake, including ciphersuite negotiation, key exchange, renegotiation, and resumption, treated as a detailed 3,600-line executable model. We present our main definitions, constructions, and proofs for an abstract model of the protocol, featuring series of related runs of the handshake with different ciphersuites.

Because the test to see if the loop should end is in the middle of a logical set of steps, the while loop itself currently doesn't check anything meaningful; the check is instead performed at the \"proper\" place within the conceptual algorithm. I was told that this is bad code, because it is more bug-prone due to the ending condition not being checked by the loop structure. It's more difficult to figure out how you'd exit the loop, and could invite bugs as the breaking condition might be bypassed or omitted accidentally given future changes. Now, the code could be structured as follows:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        TransformInSomeWay(input);             while(!ProcessingComplete(input))        {           DoSomethingElseTo(input);           TransformInSomeWay(input);        }     }      However, this duplicates a call to a method in code, violating DRY; if `TransformInSomeWay` were later replaced with some other method, both calls would have to be found and changed (and the fact that there are two may be less obvious in a more complex piece of code). You could also write it like:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        var complete = false;        while(!complete)        {           TransformInSomeWay(input);                complete = ProcessingComplete(input);                if(!complete)            {              DoSomethingElseTo(input);                     }        }     }      ... but you now have a variable whose only purpose is to shift the condition- checking to the loop structure, and also has to be checked multiple times to provide the same behavior as the original logic. For my part, I say that given the algorithm this code implements in the real world, the original code is the most readable. If you were going through it yourself, this is the way you'd think about it, and so it would be intuitive to people familiar with the algorithm. So, which is \"better\"? is it better to give the responsibility of condition checking to the while loop by structuring the logic around the loop? Or is it better to structure the logic in a \"natural\" way as indicated by requirements or a conceptual description of the algorithm, even though that may mean bypassing the loop's built-in capabilities?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Programming", "Python"], "format": "Code Example", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Programming Forum", "instructed_query": "What is a Python case statement?

In this paper we employ an LSTM to compositionally capture the semantics of relational text. We dramatically demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by evaluating in a multilingual setting, in which the English training data entities overlap with the seed KB, but the Spanish text does not. Additional improvements are obtained by tying word embeddings across languages. In extensive experiments on the English and Spanish TAC KBP benchmark, our techniques provide substantial accuracy improvements.

However, most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow model that is not suitable for other popular applications. This paper focuses on one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning algorithms, as well as interactive data analysis tools. We propose a new framework called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39 GB dataset with sub-second response time.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Science", "Data Processing", "Machine Learning"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Research Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss applying Universal Schemas for domain-specific ontology expansion.

OTOH, I see the point of trying to package 5 commits in a single one to make it look niftier (specially at in a production branch), however, personally I think would be better to be able to see partial commits to a feature where some experimentation is done, even if it is not as nifty, but seeing something like \"Tried to do it way X but it is not as optimal as Y after all, doing it Z taking Y as base\" would IMHO have good value to those studying the codebase and follow the developers train of thought. My very opinionated (as in dumb, visceral, biased) point of view is that programmers like rebase to hide mistakes... and I don't think this is good for the project at all.

The novelties are that (1) decompression of arbitrary portions of the text can be done very efficiently, (2) exact search for words and phrases can be done on the compressed text directly, using any known sequential pattern-matching algorithm, and (3) word-based approximate and extended search can also be done efficiently without any decoding. The compression scheme uses a semistatic word-based model and a Huffman code where the coding alphabet is byte-oriented rather than bit-oriented. We compress typical English texts to about 30% of their original size, against 40% and 35% for Compress and Gzip, respectively. Compression time is close to that of Compress and approximately half of the time of Gzip, and decompression time is lower than that of Gzip and one third of that of Compress. We present three algorithms to search the compressed text. They allow a large number of variations over the basic word and phrase search capability, such as sets of characters, arbitrary regular expressions, and approximate matching. Separators and stopwords can be discarded at search time without significantly increasing the cost. When searching for simple words, the experiments show that running our algorithms on a compressed text is twice as fast as running the best existing software on the uncompressed version of the same text. When searching complex or approximate patterns, our algorithms are up to 8 times faster than the search on uncompressed text. We also discuss the impact of our technique in inverted files pointing to logical blocks and argue for the possibility of keeping the text compressed all the time, decompressing only for displaying purposes.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Science", "Data Compression"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss Record-Aware Two-Level Compression for Big Textual Data Analysis Acceleration.

As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a \"heartbeat\"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs.

The growing volume of such data creates challenges for data analysis including efficient and scalable algorithm, effective computing platforms and energy efficiency. Compression is a standard method for reducing data size but current standard compression algorithms are destructive to the organisation of data contents. This work introduces Content-aware, Partial Compression (CaPC) for text using a dictionary-based approach. We simply use shorter codes to replace strings while maintaining the original data format and structure, so that the compressed contents can be directly consumed by analytic platforms. We evaluate our approach with a set of real-world datasets and several classical MapReduce jobs on Hadoop. We also provide a supplementary utility library for Hadoop, hence, existing MapReduce programs can be used directly on the compressed datasets with little or no modification. In evaluation, we demonstrate that CaPC works well with a wide variety of data analysis scenarios, experimental results show ~30% average data size reduction, and up to ~32% performance increase on some I/O intensive jobs on an in-house Hadoop cluster. While the gains may seem modest, the point is that these gains are 'for free' and act as supplementary to all other optimizations.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Data Compression", "Text Analysis", "Big Data"], "format": "Research Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Academic Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss Record-Aware Two-Level Compression for Big Textual Data Analysis Acceleration.

Under misspeci cation of the parametric model, the optimal choice of the weight function is asymptotically shown to be the ratio of the density function of the covariate in the population to that in the observations. This is the pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation of sample surveys. The optimality is de ned by the expected Kullback–Leibler loss, and the optimal weight is obtained by considering the importance sampling identity. Under correct speci cation of the model, however, the ordinary maximum likelihood estimate (i.e. the uniform weight) is shown to be optimal asymptotically. For moderate sample size, the situation is in between the two extreme cases, and the weight function is selected by minimizing a variant of the information criterion derived as an estimate of the expected loss. The method is also applied to a weighted version of the Bayesian predictive density. Numerical examples as well as Monte-Carlo simulations are shown for polynomial regression.

We do not require that the users and items in the two domains be identical or even overlap. Based on the limited ratings in the target matrix, we establish a bridge between the two rating matrices at a clusterlevel of user-item rating patterns in order to transfer more useful knowledge from the auxiliary task domain. We first compress the ratings in the auxiliary rating matrix into an informative and yet compact cluster-level rating pattern representation referred to as a codebook. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for reconstructing the target rating matrix by expanding the codebook.

We are dealing with work orders that are needed to maintain equipment. We have a bit of a disagreement in regards to the structure of the contract. There are two methods on my side, I would like a single work order class with all properties related to the work order in it. example (simplified)               WO - class       Number - property       Description - property       WarrantyStatus - property       WarrantySettlementDate - property       LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] - list property       Children<WO>[] - list property      On their side, they want to create a work order class, but for each logical group of data, they want to create another class to wrap the properties. example (simplified)               WO - class       WOHeader - class         Number - property         Description - property       Warranty - class         WarrantyStatus - property         WarrantySettlementDate - property       LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] - list property       Children<WO>[] - list property      Now they will have approx 8 classes in the full definition that they want to create all with a few properties in each. This seems a bit over the top to me and has a bit of a code smell or anti pattern feel to it. For my example, I have two classes, WO and LabourStep. They have 4 classes for the same thing WO,WOHeader,Warranty,LabourStep. There will only ever be one WOHeader per WO and the same for Warranty. My one seems far simpler to manage changes (add a new property to WO and thats it), but is less human readable. On their side, The structure is a little more easier to read by a human, but it feel like its pushing a logical view onto the contract the doesn't really belong. And to add a new property potentially requires a modification to the WO and the creation of a new class if a new logical group was added. These extra classes are only there to group properties. What is the right way to go? ======EDIT========== Frank - I completely agree with your thoughts and it is the way I approach my development. Except in this case, the third party monolithic enterprise system we are integrating with has been written in a very generic way to try and cater for as many businesses as possible. The data is spread across three tables in a one to one mapping with the majority in one table. There is barely any validation. There is no concept of a \"Warranty\" object/thing in that system. Its just 3 properties against a WO. All the web service will do is act like a data store, with the WO persisted as a whole. e.g. getWO() updateWO() createWO(). There will never be get/updateWarranty() methods. It's all just one blob of data to read/persist. On our side, we never use the result directly from web services even if they are our own. We convert them into proper models and then use those. To us a data contract is very different to a model. There is no business logic in the data contract, its purely a container to get data from one part of the system to another without closely coupling them. That means we can easily change to persist to a database instead of a web service and all its needs to do is match the interface of the web service. This also allows us to modify our own models which may even include results from multiple web services without having to worry about being restricted to or changing the format of the data contracts. So when I think in those terms, Having the data contracts split into WOHeader or WOWarranty classes just doesn't make any sense. It will never used in that way, not even by them. Its just there for a nice logical group of properties that mean nothing by themselves. A region block around those properties would have the same net effect. Labour steps and equipment details however, make a lot of sense to be in separate classes as they are separate entities and not just properties of work orders.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Design", "Interface", "Data Structure"], "format": "Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Forum", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Should interface only be used for behavior and not to show logical data grouped together?

When studies attempt to group queries together by task or session, a timeout is typically used to identify the boundary. However, users query search engines in order to accomplish tasks at a variety of granularities, issuing multiple queries as they attempt to accomplish tasks. In this work we study real sessions manually labeled into hierarchical tasks, and show that timeouts, whatever their length, are of limited utility in identifying task boundaries, achieving a maximum precision of only 70%. We report on properties of this search task hierarchy, as seen in a random sample of user interactions from a major web search engine's log, annotated by human editors, learning that 17% of tasks are interleaved, and 20% are hierarchically organized. No previous work has analyzed or addressed automatic identification of interleaved and hierarchically organized search tasks. We propose and evaluate a method for the automated segmentation of users' query streams into hierarchical units. Our classifiers can improve on timeout segmentation, as well as other previously published approaches, bringing the accuracy up to 92% for identifying fine-grained task boundaries, and 89-97% for identifying pairs of queries from the same task when tasks are interleaved hierarchically.

In Joel Spolsky's famous (or infamous) article Thins You Should Never Do, Part I, he makes the case that doing a rewrite is always a wrong move because:   1. It automatically puts you behind (your competitors/schedule/etc.)   2. The code probably isn't as bad as the programmers believe (anything someone else wrote is always a mess, although some are bigger messes than others - and even then)   3. It's probably easier/quicker/cheaper to fix what's truly wrong with it than to rewrite from scratch.   4. In rewriting from scratch, you are probably going to re-introduce bugs that were fixed in previous versions the original code. Instead, he recommends fixing what's wrong with the code.

I'm trying to collect a set of rules/guideline for my team, and one of them (based on Joel's article) is               We don’t re-write ... ever!      - But we can refactor large portions of the code.

So you had a choice of sticking with an unsupported database with unsupported tools or rewriting the Forms from scratch (or converted with 3rd party tools and then gone over with a fine toothed comb). Which I will call porting, particularly when you are doing a faithful line by line/function by function translation into the new tech and not adding any functionality. The rule then became:               We don’t re-write ... ever!     - But we can refactor large portions of the code.     - And we can port the code to a new platform when we *truly* have no other        choice.

I've worked at four companies so far and I've become aware of a lack of attention to keeping code clean and dealing with technical debt that hinders future progress in a software app. For example, the first company I worked for had written a database from scratch rather than use something like MySQL and that created hell for the team when refactoring or extending the application. I've always tried to be honest and clear with my manager when he discusses projections, but management doesn't seem interested in fixing what's already there and it's horrible to see the impact it has on team morale. What are your thoughts on the best way to tackle this problem? What I've seen is people packing up and leaving. The company then becomes a revolving door with developers coming in and out and making the code worse.

Several techniques are investigated for combining both spatial and spectral information. Spatial information is extracted at the object (set of pixels) level rather than at the conventional pixel level. Mathematical morphology is first used to derive the morphological profile of the image, which includes characteristics about the size, orientation, and contrast of the spatial structures present in the image. Then, the morphological neighborhood is defined and used to derive additional features for classification. Classification is performed with support vector machines (SVMs) using the available spectral information and the extracted spatial information. Spatial postprocessing is next investigated to build more homogeneous and spatially consistent thematic maps. To that end, three presegmentation techniques are applied to define regions that are used to regularize the preliminary pixel-wise thematic map. Finally, a multiple-classifier (MC) system is defined to produce relevant markers that are exploited to segment the hyperspectral image with the minimum spanning forest algorithm. Experimental results conducted on three real hyperspectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions and corresponding to various contexts are presented. They highlight the importance of spectral-spatial strategies for the accurate classification of hyperspectral images and validate the proposed methods.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Machine Learning", "Remote Sensing", "Hyperspectral Imaging"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss the learning of sensor-specific spatial-spectral features of hyperspectral images via convolutional neural networks.

Applications include the continuous authentication of radio and TV Internet broadcasts, and authenticated data distribution by satellite. The main challenges are fourfold. First, authenticity must be guaranteed even when only the sender of the data is trusted. Second, the scheme needs to scale to potentially millions of receivers. Third, streamed media distribution can have high packet loss. Finally, the system needs to be efficient to support fast packet rates. We propose two efficient schemes, TESLA and EMSS, for secure lossy multicast streams. TESLA, short for Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication, offers sender authentication, strong loss robustness, high scalability, and minimal overhead, at the cost of loose initial time synchronization and slightly delayed authentication. EMSS, short for Efficient Multi-chained Stream Signature, provides nonrepudiation of origin, high loss resistance, and low overhead, at the cost of slightly delayed verification.

Consider face recognition for example. A low-de\"nition face image of size 64 64 implies a feature space of 64 64\"4096 dimensions, and therefore scatter matrices of size 4096 4096\"16M. First, it is computationally challenging to handle big matrices (such as computing eigenvalues). Second, those matrices are almost always singular, as the number of training images needs to be at least 16M for them to be non-degenerate. Due to these di$culties, it is commonly believed that a direct LDA solution for such high-dimensional data is infeasible.

We present a framework that capitalizes on temporal structure in unlabeled video to learn to anticipate human actions and objects. The key idea behind our approach is that we can train deep networks to predict the visual representation of images in the future. Visual representations are a promising prediction target because they encode images at a higher semantic level than pixels yet are automatic to compute.

At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces.

In addition, we derive a simple method of replacing costly computation of nonlinear (on-line) Bayesian similarity measures by inexpensive linear (off-line) subspace projections and simple Euclidean norms, thus resulting in a significant computational speed-up for implementation with very large databases.

The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers[6]. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest.

Abstract We investigate the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in computer vision. SVM is a learning technique developed by V. Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs.) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classi ers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Machine Learning", "Ground Penetrating Radar"], "format": "Conference Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Proceedings of CVPR", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss buried object detection from B-scan ground penetrating radar data using Faster-RCNN.

Although the advent of these techniques has gradually enabled clarification of the functional contributions of the prefrontal cortex in deception with respect to executive function, the specific roles of subregions within the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions responsible for emotional regulation or social interactions during deception are still unclear. Assuming that the processes of falsifying truthful responses and deceiving others are differentially associated with the activities of these regions, we conducted a positron emission tomography experiment with 2 (truth, lie) 2 (honesty, dishonesty) factorial design. The main effect of falsifying the truthful responses revealed increased brain activity of the left dorsolateral and right anterior prefrontal cortices, supporting the interpretation of previous studies that executive functions are related to making untruthful responses. The main effect of deceiving the interrogator showed activations of the ventromedial prefrontal (medial orbitofrontal) cortex and amygdala, adding new evidence that the brain regions assumed to be responsible for emotional processing or social interaction are active during deceptive behavior similar to that in real-life situations. Further analysis revealed that activity of the right anterior prefrontal cortex showed both effects of deception, indicating that this region has a pivotal role in telling lies.

Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings.

An extensive suite of experimental results documents the robot’s significant “intrinsic mobility”—the traversal of rugged, broken, and obstacle-ridden ground without any terrain sensing or actively controlled adaptation.

Unlike the wheeled mobile robots, which are normally assumed to obey the nonholonomic constraints, slippage is unavoidable for a tracked mobile robot, especially in stair climbing. Furthermore, the track-stair interactive forces are complicated, which may take the forms of grouser-tread hooking force, track--stair edge frictional force, grouser-riser clutching force, and even their compositions. In this paper, the track--stair interactions are analyzed systematically, and tipover stability criteria are derived for a tracked mobile robot climbing stairs.

Legs allow to climb over obstacles and change the height of the robot, modifying its viewpoint of the world. Tracks are efficient on uneven terrains or on soft surfaces (snow, mud, etc.), while wheels are optimal on flat surfaces. Our objective is to work on a new concept capable of combining different locomotion mechanisms to increase the locomotion capabilities of the robotic platform. The design we came up with, called AZIMUT, is symmetrical and is made of four independent leg-track-wheel articulations. It can move with its articulations up, down or straight, allowing the robot to deal with three-dimensional environments. AZIMUT is also capable of moving sideways without changing its orientation, making it omnidirectional. By putting sensors on these articulations, the robot can also actively perceive its environment by changing the orientation of its articulations. Designing a robot with such capabilities requires addressing difficult design compromises, with measurable impacts seen only after integrating all of the components together.

Should I avoid private methods now?", "document": "I very often hear the following: \"If you want to test private methods, you'd better put that in another class and expose it.\" While sometimes that's the case and we have a hiding concept inside our class, other times you end up with classes that have the same attributes (or, worst, every attribute of one class become a argument on a method in the other class) and exposes functionality that is, in fact, implementation detail. Specially on TDD, when you **refactor** a class with public methods out of a previous tested class, that class is now part of your interface, but has no tests to it (since you refactored it, and is a implementation detail). Now, I may be not finding an obvious better answer, but if my answer is the \"correct\", that means that sometimes writting unit tests can break encapsulation, and divide the same responsibility into different classes. A simple example would be testing a setter method when a getter is not actually needed for anything in the real code. Please when aswering don't provide simple answers to specific cases I may have written. Rather, try to explain more of the generic case and theoretical approach. And this is neither language specific. Thanks in advance. **EDIT:** The answer given by Matthew Flynn was really insightful, but didn't quite answer the question. Altough he made the fair point that you either don't test private methods or extract them because they really are other concern and responsibility (or at least that was what I could understand from his answer), I think there are situations where unit testing private methods is useful. My primary example is when you have a class that has one responsibility but the output (or input) that it gives (takes) is just to complex. For example, a hashing function. There's no good way to break a hashing function apart and mantain cohesion and encapsulation. However, testing a hashing function can be really tough, since you would need to calculate by hand (you can't use code calculation to test code calculation!) the hashing, and test multiple cases where the hash changes. In that way (and this may be a question worth of its own topic) I think private method testing is the best way to handle it. Now, I'm not sure if I should ask another question, or ask it here, but are there any better way to test such complex output (input)? OBS: Please, if you think I should ask another question on that topic, leave a comment. :) **EDIT2:** I accepted a answer as my correct because it made me think and decide my course of action, altough it didn't answered my queston completely. But for those who face the same problem as I do (one cohesive class that will change together, but is still too hard to test by itsfelf), I'll tell what I did and why. I decided that the output of that class is simply too hard to a computer to test correctly, so I didn't test it. I could have used a framework to test it's private methods (which would be the best idea, I think), but I didn't want to get to that point. If you are wondering what it is that is cohesive and respects SRP, and still is too hard to a computer to test, I'll give some examples: heightmap generation, hashing functions, procedural music generation (you can test some units, but the highest level unit is simply too subjective).", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Software Development", "Testing", "TDD"], "format": "Forum Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "StackOverflow", "instructed_query": "As a developer new to TDD, should I avoid private methods now?

{"dataset": "beir/cqadupstack/programmers", "query_id": "193929", "query": "\"Too object-oriented\"", "document": "I've been recently assigned for a new high-performance C++ project (finance) together with 3 other guys who, like, me, refer to themselves as \"primarily C/C++ programmers\", meaning, all of us have also done Java & other stuff, we all have comparable experience (8 to 10 years) and have successfully collaborated for the making of other projects (not C/C++). I soon found out we have such different mindsets when it comes to our \"mother programming tongue\" that it risks not only the good delivery of the project but also the general well-being of the team/office. Specifically: They come from an electrical engineering/automation/polytechnic type of background, so their reasoning is intimately related to how hardware works, how bytes move around, processor workings, instruction caching, generally everything at the lower layers. They did embedded programming, ARM programming (I barely know what those are). I soon found out their practical experience is with mostly C, not C++. They think procedurally, not OOP. I, on the other hand, have trained myself to think in a more abstract way, to apply principles such as encapsulation, low coupling/high cohesion for creating reusable, modular software. My speciality is the C++ programming language, with an accent on language constructs that help you get both fast and reusable, generic code. I think design patterns, idioms, concepts. Throughout 9 years of developing software I consistently witnessed how poor maintainability of software systems is by far the #1 burden of teams. I generously document my code, write careful interfaces. I embrace template meta-programming as a way to obtain fast and reusable products. I embrace the new C++11 standard features. Where I see reusability and loose coupling, they see \"complication\". They want to \"see it all there\". They want to see `char*`, not some buffer class in interface methods. At one point one even said \"I don't care how simple your interfaces are if your implementation looks complicated\". The trouble is, we really are trying to transition from a monolithic style of systems to a reusable one - we are writing a library. Yet they don't wish to see their C-style structs being polluted with templated methods, typedefs and c-tors, even if neither makes their structs non-POD. They also don't wish to see static_assert(std::is_pod<...>). They love memcpy and pointers and generally stay away from references. They tend to think typedefs are somehow evil. I really tried to make them see an abstraction for what it is. It is code together with data it operates on. By necessity, a library needs to define some interfaces for the user to be able to plug it into a larger product. They tend to see these interfaces as ways in which my code _requires their code behave/look as I wish and doesn't allow them to do things their way_ , but without actually telling me a specific functionality they can't obtain. Make no mistake, I'm no ignorant when it comes to performance. I know about cache lines, branch prediction, the overhead of method virtualization, heap allocation, hash lookups. I'm good with complexity of algorithms (though that doesn't matter so much here), data structures, inlining and some other compiler optimizations such as RVO. I believe with a modern compiler a reusable, layered OOP C++ product can get within 10% of the performance of a C-only monolithic product, when carefully written and optimized. I honestly believed we would complement each other in our thinking. What are your thoughts?

On the other hand most OO code I've seen has extensive getters and setters. When are getters and setters justified? Do you try to avoid using them? Are they overused in general? If your favorite language has properties (mine does) then such things are also considered getters and setters for this question. They are same thing from an OO methodology perspective. They just have nicer syntax. Sources for Getter/Setter Criticism (some taken from comments to give them better visibility):   * http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0905-toolbox.html   * http://typicalprogrammer.com/?p=23   * http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AccessorsAreEvil   * http://www.darronschall.com/weblog/2005/03/no-brain-getter-and-setters.cfm   * http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/encapsulation_violation_with_getters_and To state the criticism simply: Getters and Setters allow you to manipulate the internal state of objects from outside of the object. This violates encapsulation. Only the object itself should care about its internal state. And an example Procedural version of code.               struct Fridge     {         int cheese;     }          void go_shopping(Fridge fridge)     {          fridge.cheese += 5;     }      Mutator version of code:               class Fridge     {          int cheese;               void set_cheese(int _cheese) { cheese = _cheese; }          int get_cheese() { return cheese; }      }          void go_shopping(Fridge fridge)     {          fridge.set_cheese(fridge.get_cheese() + 5);             }      The getters and setters made the code much more complicated without affording proper encapsulation. Because the internal state is accessible to other objects we don't gain a whole lot by adding these getters and setters.

ETL (Extraction-Transformation-Loading) processes are responsible for the extraction of data from heterogeneous operational data sources, their transformation (conversion, cleaning, normalization, etc.) and their loading into DWs. ETL processes are a key component of DWs because incorrect or misleading data will produce wrong business decisions, and therefore, a correct design of these processes at early stages of a DW project is absolutely necessary to improve data quality. However, not much research has dealt with the modeling of ETL processes. In this paper, we present our approach, based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which allows us to accomplish the conceptual modeling of these ETL processes together with the conceptual schema of the target DW in an integrated manner. We provide the necessary mechanisms for an easy and quick specification of the common operations defined in these ETL processes such as, the integration of different data sources, the transformation between source and target attributes, the generation of surrogate keys and so on. Moreover, our approach allows the designer a comprehensive tracking and documentation of entire ETL processes, which enormously facilitates the maintenance of these processes. Another advantage of our proposal is the use of the UML (standardization, ease-of-use and functionality) and the seamless integration of the design of the ETL processes with the DW conceptual schema.

With technological advance on microelectronic and vision system, high performance automatic techniques on biometric recognition are now becoming economically feasible. Among all the biometric identification methods, face recognition has attracted much attention in recent years because it has potential to be most nonintrusive and user-friendly. The PDBNN face recognition system consists of three modules: First, a face detector finds the location of a human face in an image. Then an eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes in order to generate meaningful feature vectors. The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes, and nose, but excluding mouth (eye-glasses will be allowed). Lastly, the third module is a face recognizer. The PDBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules. It adopts a hierarchical network structures with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. The paper demonstrates a successful application of PDBNN to face recognition applications on two public (FERET and ORL) and one in-house (SCR) databases. Regarding the performance, experimental results on three different databases such as recognition accuracies as well as false rejection and false acceptance rates are elaborated. As to the processing speed, the whole recognition process (including PDBNN processing for eye localization, feature extraction, and classification) consumes approximately one second on Sparc10, without using hardware accelerator or co-processor.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Face Recognition", "Biometrics"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss Face Detection Using Quantized Skin Color Regions Merging and Wavelet Packet Analysis in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Face Recognition", "Image Processing"], "format": "Research Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Academic Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss the topic of face detection using quantized skin color regions merging and wavelet packet analysis.

Applying results from the prior literature, we show that although it is feasible to price so as to distinguish high-value and low-value consumers, the merchant will never find it optimal to do so.

Recent advances in information acquisition and processing technologies have allowed online vendors to offer varieties of web-based personalization that not only increases switching costs, but also serves as important means of acquiring valuable customer information. However, investments in online personalization may be severely undermined if consumers do not use these services due to privacy concerns. In the absence of any empirical evidence that seeks to understand this consumer dilemma, our research develops a parsimonious model to predict consumers’ usage of online personalization as a result of the tradeoff between their value for personalization and concern for privacy. In addition to this tradeoff, we find that a consumer’s intent to use personalization services is positively influenced by her trust in the vendor. Our findings suggest that: 1. online vendors can improve their abilities to acquire and use customer information through trust building activities; 2. it is of critical importance that vendors understand and evaluate the different values consumers may place in enjoying various types of personalization.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Marketing", "Consumer Behavior", "Privacy"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss the findings of the experiment titled 'When 25 Cents is Too Much: An Experiment on Willingness-To-Sell and Willingness-To-Protect Personal Information'.

HSI data often lie on sparse, nonlinear manifolds whose geometric and topological structures can be exploited via manifold-learning techniques. In this article, we focused on demonstrating the opportunities provided by manifold learning for classification of remotely sensed data. However, limitations and opportunities remain both for research and applications. Although these methods have been demonstrated to mitigate the impact of physical effects that affect electromagnetic energy traversing the atmosphere and reflecting from a target, nonlinearities are not always exhibited in the data, particularly at lower spatial resolutions, so users should always evaluate the inherent nonlinearity in the data. Manifold learning is data driven, and as such, results are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the data, and one method will not consistently provide the best results. Nonlinear manifold-learning methods require parameter tuning, although experimental results are typically stable over a range of values, and have higher computational overhead than linear methods, which is particularly relevant for large-scale remote sensing data sets. Opportunities for advancing manifold learning also exist for analysis of hyperspectral and multisource remotely sensed data. Manifolds are assumed to be inherently smooth, an assumption that some data sets may violate, and data often contain classes whose spectra are distinctly different, resulting in multiple manifolds or submanifolds that cannot be readily integrated with a single manifold representation. Developing appropriate characterizations that exploit the unique characteristics of these submanifolds for a particular data set is an open research problem for which hierarchical manifold structures appear to have merit. To date, most work in manifold learning has focused on feature extraction from single images, assuming stationarity across the scene. Research is also needed in joint exploitation of global and local embedding methods in dynamic, multitemporal environments and integration with semisupervised and active learning.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Remote Sensing", "Hyperspectral Imaging", "Machine Learning"], "format": "Journal Article", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Scientific Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss Active-Metric Learning for Classification of Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Images.

This overfitting is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random “dropout” gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition. A feedforward, artificial neural network uses layers of non-linear hidden units between its inputs and its outputs. By adapting the weights on the incoming connections of these hidden units it learns feature detectors that enable it to predict the correct output when given an input vector [15]. If the relationship between the input and the correct output is complicated and the network has enough hidden units to model it accurately, there will typically be many different settings of the weights that can model the training set almost perfectly, especially if there is only a limited amount of labeled training data. Each of these weight vectors will make different predictions on held-out test data and almost all of them will do worse on the test data than on the training data because the feature detectors have been tuned to work well together on the training data but not on the test data. Overfitting can be reduced by using “dropout” to prevent complex co-adaptations on the training data. On each presentation of each training case, each hidden unit is randomly omitted from the network with a probability of 0.5, so a hidden unit cannot rely on other hidden units being present. Another way to view the dropout procedure is as a very efficient way of performing model averaging with neural networks. A good way to reduce the error on the test set is to average the predictions produced by a very large number of different networks. The standard way to do this is to train many separate networks and then to apply each of these networks to the test data, but this is computationally expensive during both training and testing. Random dropout makes it possible to train a huge number of different networks in a reasonable time. There is almost certainly a different network for each presentation of each training case but all of these networks share the same weights for the hidden units that are present. We use the standard, stochastic gradient descent procedure for training the dropout neural networks on mini-batches of training cases, but we modify the penalty term that is normally used to prevent the weights from growing too large. Instead of penalizing the squared length (L2 norm) of the whole weight vector, we set an upper bound on the L2 norm of the incoming weight vector for each individual hidden unit. If a weight-update violates this constraint, we renormalize the weights of the hidden unit by division. Using a constraint rather than a penalty prevents weights from growing very large no matter how large the proposed weight-update is.

In this paper, we develop two new iterative algorithms to register a range scan to a previous scan so as to compute relative robot positions in an unknown environment, that avoid the above problems. The rst algorithm is based on matching data points with tangent directions in two scans and minimizing a distance function in order to solve the displacement between the scans. The second algorithm establishes correspondences between points in the two scans and then solves the point-to-point least-squares problem to compute the relative pose of the two scans.

This paper explores the application of Bacterial Foraging Optimization to the problem of mobile robot navigation to determine shortest feasible path to move from any current position to target position in unknown environment with moving obstacles. It develops a new algorithm based on Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) technique. This algorithm finds a path towards the target and avoiding the obstacles using particles which are randomly distributed on a circle around a robot. The criterion on which it selects the best particle is the distance to target and the Gaussian cost function of the particle. Then, a high level decision strategy is used for the selection and thus proceeds for the result. It works on local environment by using a simple robot sensor. So, it is free from having generated additional map which adds cost. Furthermore, it can be implemented without requirement to tuning algorithm and complex calculation. To simulate the algorithm, the program is written in C language and the environment is created by OpenGL. To test the efficiency of proposed technique, results are compared with Basic Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) and another well-known algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). From the experimental result it can be told that the proposed method gives better path or optimal path.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Robotics", "Optimization", "Algorithms"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss path planning through the PSO algorithm in complex environments.

Statistical methods in machine translation (e.g. (Brown et al., 1990)) typically rely on large quantities of bilingual text aligned at the document or sentence level, and a number of approaches in the burgeoning field of crosslanguage information retrieval exploit parallel corpora either in place of or in addition to mappings between languages based on information from bilingual dictionaries (Davis and Dunning, 1995; Landauer and Littman, 1990; Hull and Oard, 1997; Oard, 1997). Despite the utility of such data, however, sources of bilingual text are subject to such limitations as licensing restrictions, usage fees, restricted domains or genres, and dated text (such as 1980's Canadian politics); or such sources simply may not exist for * This work was supported by Department of Defense contract MDA90496C1250, DARPA/ITO Contract N66001-97-C-8540, and a research grant from Sun Microsystems Laboratories.

Although the majority of Web content is in English, it also shows great promise as a source of multilingual content. Using figures from the Babel survey of multilinguality on the Web (h tZp : / /www. i s o c . o r g / ) , it is possible to estimate that as of June, 1997, there were on the order of 63000 primarily non-English Web servers, ranging over 14 languages. Moreover, a followup investigation of the non-English servers suggests that nearly a third contain some useful cross-language data, such as parallel English on the page or links to parallel English pages the follow-up also found pages in five languages not identified by the Babel study (Catalan, Chinese, Hungarian, Icelandic, and Arabic; Michael Littman, personal communication). Given the continued explosive increase in the size of the Web, the trend toward business organizations that cross national boundaries, and high levels of competition for consumers in a global marketplace, it seems impossible not to view multilingual content on the Web as an expanding resource. Moreover, it is a dynamic resource, changing in content as the world changes. For example, Diekema et al., in a presentation at the 1998 TREC-7 conference (Voorhees and Harman, 1998), observed that the performance of their cross-language information retrieval was hurt by lexical gaps such as Bosnia/Bosniethis illustrates a highly topical missing pair in their static lexical resource (which was based on WordNet 1.5). And Gey et al., also at TREC-7, observed that in doing cross-language retrieval using commercial machine translation systems, gaps in the lexicon (their example was acupuncture/Akupunktur) could make the difference between precision of 0.08 and precision of 0.83 on individual queries. ttesnik (1998) presented an algorithm called", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Machine Translation", "Natural Language Processing"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Conference Proceedings", "instructed_query": "Discuss the improved statistical machine translation using monolingually-derived paraphrases.

Since developing this standard, the Joint Video Team of the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has also standardized an extension of that technology that is referred to as multiview video coding (MVC). MVC provides a compact representation for multiple views of a video scene, such as multiple synchronized video cameras. Stereo-paired video for 3-D viewing is an important special case of MVC. The standard enables inter-view prediction to improve compression capability, as well as supporting ordinary temporal and spatial prediction. It also supports backward compatibility with existing legacy systems by structuring the MVC bitstream to include a compatible “base view.” Each other view is encoded at the same picture resolution as the base view. In recognition of its high-quality encoding capability and support for backward compatibility, the stereo high profile of the MVC extension was selected by the Blu-Ray Disc Association as the coding format for 3-D video with high-definition resolution. This paper provides an overview of the algorithmic design used for extending H.264/MPEG-4 AVC towards MVC. The basic approach of MVC for enabling inter-view prediction and view scalability in the context of H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is reviewed.

Specifically, as hand-held devices are carried by human beings, we leverage two key social phenomena, namely social trust and social reciprocity, to promote efficient cooperation among devices. With this insight, we develop a coalitional game theoretic framework to devise social-tie based cooperation strategies for device-to-device communications. We also develop a network assisted relay selection mechanism to implement the coalitional game solution, and show that the mechanism is immune to group deviations, individually rational, and truthful.

Deviceto- device (D2D) communications is a promising technique to provide wireless peer-to-peer services and enhance spectrum utilization in the LTE-Advanced networks. In D2D communications, the user equipments (UEs) are allowed to directly communicate between each other by reusing the cellular resources rather than using uplink and downlink resources in the cellular mode when communicating via the base station. However, enabling D2D communications in a cellular network poses two major challenges. First, the interference caused to the cellular users by D2D devices could critically affect the performances of the cellular devices. Second, the minimum quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of D2D communications need to be guaranteed. In this article, we introduce a novel resource allocation scheme (i.e. joint resource block scheduling and power control) for D2D communications in LTE-Advanced networks to maximize the spectrum utilization while addressing the above challenges. First, an overview of LTE-Advanced networks, and architecture and signaling support for provisioning of D2D communications in these networks are described. Furthermore, research issues and the current state-of-the-art of D2D communications are discussed. Then, a resource allocation scheme based on a column generation method is proposed for D2D communications. The objective is to maximize the spectrum utilization by finding the minimum transmission length in terms of time slots for D2D links while protecting the cellular users from harmful interference and guaranteeing the QoS of D2D links. The performance of this scheme is evaluated through simulations.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["IoT", "Resource Management", "Telecommunications"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Please provide a long academic paper in English on a survey of resource management in IoT operating systems for researchers.\",\n  \"reversed_query\": \"Please do not provide a long academic paper in English on a survey of resource management in IoT operating systems for researchers.\"\n}\n```", "reversed_query": ""}

My impression is that projects using a DI framework like Spring or Guice tend to lose their object orientation and degenerate to a purely procedural design:   1. DI not only centralizes the question of which implementation of an object to use but also manages the life-cycle of these objects. Many OO **design patterns** , however, rely on the ability of business logic to wire objects. I wouldn't know, for example, how to implement a Strategy Pattern in Spring because the decision which of the concrete strategies to use, is statically determined by the configuration of the application instead of a piece of code. Same goes for decorator, composite, observer, ...   2. The reason above leads to a design where functionality and data are separated. Because you don't want to let the DI container decide when data is created, you split any code off the data in order to have only this part managed by the DI container. This is contrary to the idea of OO where **code and data should reside together** in one unit. This breaks the **encapsulation of data** because all fields of the data \"beans\" are exposed by public getters and setters.   3. You can't use **polymorphism** anymore because code is not linked to its data anymore and the \"virtual functions\" can't work. This leads to those instanceof cascades that we all know we shouldn't use. Also, we lose all those designs that rely on polymorphism.   4. The DI container will inject managed beans only in objects which are also managed by it. So you can't **mix managed beans and normal objects** because there can't be any \"non-managed gaps\" in the reference chain of managed beans. So once you started with DI, you need to put all other code under the control of the DI container and you can't use normal objects anymore. I suppose that this is the reason why the separation of code and data is done so rigorously in DI projects. I see that there are reasons why to use DI but is it really worth giving up so much? Don't people care about OO? Apart from this **article** , I can't find any discussions on this topic. Or is it just me who doesn't understand how to do this properly? Any ideas how the four points above can be tackled with? **Appendix 1: Explanation of strategy pattern** I refer to the example here. Let's assume there's a DI version of it where all implementations of `Strategy` and the `Context` are injected to `StrategyExample`. Then `StrategyExample` doesn't decide anymore which `Strategy` to inject into `Context` but the configuration would have already decided which implementation to inject into `Context`. So yes, DI heavily applies the Strategy Pattern. But it always does so statically.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Engineering", "Design Patterns"], "format": "Forum Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "StackOverflow", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Does 'Inversion of Control' promote 'Anemic Domain Model'?

Is there a good rule of thumb?", "document": "I want to introduce the concept of unit tests (and testing in general) to my co-workers; right now there are no tests at all and things are tested by actually performing the tasks via the UI to see the desired result. As you might imagine, the code is very tightly coupled to the exact implementation - even resulting in code that should be in a class and reused across the system being copied and pasted across methods. Due to changed requirements, I have been asked to modify a module I previously wrote and that is fairly loosely coupled (not as much as I would like, but as best I can get without having to introduce a lot of other concepts). I've decided to include a suite of unit tests with my revised code to \"prove\" that it works as expected and demonstrate how testing works; I'm not following true TDD as some of the code is already written but I'm hoping to follow some TDD concepts for the new code I'll have to create. Now, inevitably I'm sure I'll be asked why it's taking me more than a day or two to write the code, since parts of what I'll be interacting with already exist in the system (albeit without any tests and very tightly coupled), and when I check the code in I'll be asked just what this \"Tests\" project is. I can explain the basics of testing, but I can't explain the actual benefits in a way the others would understand (because they think testing requires you to run the app yourself, since often the actual UI matters in determining if the feature \"works\" or not). They don't understand the idea of loose coupling (clearly evident by the fact nothing is loosely coupled; there aren't even any interfaces outside of the code I've written), so trying to use that as a benefit would probably earn me a \"Huh?\" kind of look, and again I can't be as loose as I would like to without having to rework several existing modules and probably introduce some kind of IoC container, which would be viewed as wasting time and not \"programming\". Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can point to this code and say \"We should start creating unit tests\" without coming off as either condescending (e.g. \"Writing tests forces you to write good code.\" which would probably be taken to mean code except mine is _bad_ ) or without making it seem like a waste of time that doesn't add any real value?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Software Development", "Testing", "Open Source"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Personal Blog", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"How do you judge the value of using TDD or plain unit testing in an Open Source project?

The types of applications I am developing always have a custom aspect to them. So there will always be some code written which is client specific for every project. The method we are using now is as follows: Several 'CORE' projects exist in isolation from one another, each core project is a class library which is capable of running on its own, or with dependencies on other core modules. All of these core modules are documented (Sandcastle) and NuGet packages created for them, which are served up via a private NuGet feed. When a customer purchases the software we create a customer specific project which implements the bespoke code that they require, and pulls in the NuGet packages from the core libs as needed. The build of this project is what is provided to the customer, and each customer project has it's own Git repository. This has worked fine for a year or so, but I feel that as we add features to the core libraries the number of nuget packages is growing quite quickly. Is there a better method of organising code, whilst making sure there are not seperate version of the same code lying around? I know in this stackoverflow post it states that: > Google manages to keep the source code of all its projects, over 2000, in a > single code trunk containing hundreds of millions of code lines, with more > than 5,000 developers accessing the same repository. But this seems like it produce problems for us, due to having bespoke deployments. Any ideas or comments on what I am doing wrong? ## Edit The problems I foresee going with the google way are mainly to do with release management and build issues. We use continuous integration, so that every commit a build will be triggered and test automatically run.

I am also extremely familiar with openssl command line tools. However, I have very little experience with web based PKI enabled projects & hence I am trying to design and code a personal project for understanding this better. ## The requirements This is the website for a bank. All Internet Banking users are allowed use any certificate issued by a few known CAs (verisign, Thawte, entrust etc). The Bank is not responsible for procuring certificates for the user. These certificates will be used for authentication to the banks website either instead of or as an add-on to username/password login. The platforms/OS etc are still not fixed. Assume that enrollment has been done - i.e. bank knows the certificate going to be used by each user. ## Design I was wondering what's the best way to do authentication?   1. I saw that Apache has a way to enable 2 way ssl - in this case, i think navigating to the website would automatically ask for a cert from the user. But I am not sure if this is enough because it seems that all it verifies is whether a certificate is signed by a trusted CA & also may be whether it falls in a white list of subject lines of the certificates etc. But this is not enough for a bank case because you need to be able to associate a bankuserid with a certificate.   2. IIS seems to have a way by which I can have a certificate stored for each user in Active Directory. This is what I understood from reading few MSDN articles. You turn on 2 way SSL in IIS & then when the user tries to navigate to the website, IIS will send a request to the browser with a list of approved CAs and browser will let the user pick an appropriate certificate from his certstore and sends it to backend.

Both teams are located in India. I am on the west coast of the U.S. I'm finding leading remote teams challenging: First, their command of the English language is weak. Second, I'm having difficultly understanding them through their accents. Third is timing, we are 12 hours apart. We use Skype to communicate. I have a month to get the project done. We've burned through a week just setting up the environments. At this point I'm considering working their hours, 11p PDT to 7a PDT, to get them up to speed, so that I can get the project off the ground. A 12 hour lag time is too much. I'm looking for steps I can take to be successful at leading an offshore team. **Update** The offshore team's primary task is coding, of course, most coding tasks do involve some design work. The offshore team's are composed of one lead, 2 mid level (4 to 5 years) developers and a junior (~2 years) developer. The project is classic waterfall. We've handed the offshore team a business and a technical design document. We are trying to manage the offshore in an agile way. We have daily conference calls with them and I'm requiring the teams to send me a daily scrum in the form of an email answering the following questions:   1. What did I do today?   2. What am I going to do tomorrow?   3. What do I need from Chuck so I can do my job tomorrow? There is some ambiguity in the tasks. The intent was to give them enough direction for them to develop the task with out writing the code for them. I don't have a travel budget. I am using Fogbugz to track the tasks. Each task has been entered into Fogbugz and given a priority. Each team member has access to FogBugz and can choose what task they wish to complete. _Related question_ : What can we do to improve the way outsourcing/offshoring works? **Update 2** I've decided that I can not talk to the team once a day. I must work with them. Starting tonight I've started working the same hours they are. This makes me available to them when they have questions. It also allows me to gain their trust and respect. **Update 3** The project was completed and delivered on time. The key factor was me working the same time as the offshore team. If that had not occurred I'm confident we would have failed. I managed two offshore teams. One of the teams under preformed and I fired them taking on the work myself. Things that lead to success was: Communication, understand their culture and how they communicate. Build rapport with them. A couple of the workers I keep in touch a year after the project completed. Meetings, we met at the beginning of their day so any questions or blocked tasks could be addressed. At the end of the day a daily summary was send out by the worker describing their day and if they encountered any issues. Ideally we could resolve their issues by the start of their next day. Questions, ask questions. Most cases information is not volunteered. Be visible. Being online, available and reachable help fostered the team's commitment to the project. I was not just the daily email. Make it easy. Internally we had a complex QA system in which bugs where tracked. It was complex and hard to use. I paid the $$ for a fogbugz account for each of the team members. Most of the team had used FogBugz and understood the workflow. Daily I would update the fogbugz with new bugs and update the QA system from Fogbugz. **Stackoverflow question** Leading an offshore team", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Manager", "keyword": ["Project Management", "Remote Work"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Personal Blog", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Here are some tips for managing an offshore development team.

Here is their prime example: They believe that calling something like this in the controller is bad (and I agree)               @street = @invoice.customer.address.street      Their proposed solution is to do the following:               class Customer              has_one :address         belongs_to :invoice              def street             address.street         end     end          class Invoice              has_one :customer              def customer_street             customer.street         end     end          @street = @invoice.customer_street      They are stating that since you only use one dot, you are not breaking the Law of Demeter here. I think this is incorrect, because you are still going through customer to go through address to get the invoice's street. I primarily got this idea from a blog post I read: http://www.dan-manges.com/blog/37 In the blog post the prime example is               class Wallet       attr_accessor :cash     end     class Customer       has_one :wallet            # attribute delegation       def cash         @wallet.cash       end     end          class Paperboy       def collect_money(customer, due_amount)         if customer.cash < due_ammount           raise InsufficientFundsError         else           customer.cash -= due_amount           @collected_amount += due_amount         end       end     end      The blog post states that although there is only one dot `customer.cash` instead of `customer.wallet.cash`, this code still violates the Law of Demeter. > Now in the Paperboy collect_money method, we don't have two dots, we just > have one in \"customer.cash\". Has this delegation solved our problem? Not at > all. If we look at the behavior, a paperboy is still reaching directly into > a customer's wallet to get cash out. EDIT I completely understand and agree that this is still a violation and I need to create a method in `Wallet` called withdraw that handles the payment for me and that I should call that method inside the `Customer` class. What I don't get is that according to this process, my first example still violates the Law of Demeter because `Invoice` is still reaching directly into `Customer` to get the street.

Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors, such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence. These steps are considered important for the interim period, until reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal and market trends.

I am 14 and have been studying programming for 4 months now (3 months Python, 1 Month of Ruby). I haven't been pushed by my parents to do it, I took it up on my own. Whenever I try to show something I made to my dad, he says he finds no value in it. At first, I wrote simple text games, like a text version of rock paper scissors, roulette, blackjack, etc. When that got too easy, I tried to make them as advanced as possible. I made a roulette game in Ruby based off `instance_eval` and `method_missing`. I showed them to him, and he said that was \"childish\" to make games. After games got too easy, I have started extending the features of the languages, I made a module for a \"Changeable Range\" in Python, where one could just write:               j = crange.CRange(5)      then               j.shift(10)      to shift the start and stop up ten and               j.reverse()      to create a reversed range.

It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of γ-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure. Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation. In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Image Processing"], "format": "Academic Article", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss the methods of using contours to detect and localize junctions in natural images.

The mathematical characterization of singularities with Lipschitz exponents is explained. Theorems are reviewed that estimate local Lipschitz exponents of functions from the evolution across scales of their wavelet transform. It is then proven that the local maxima of the wavelet transform modulus detect the locations of irregular structures and provide numerical procedures to compute their Lipschitz exponents. The wavelet transform of singularities with fast oscillations have a particular behavior that is studied separately. The local frequency of such oscillations are measured from the wavelet transform modulus maxima. It has been shown numerically that oneand two-dimensional signals can be reconstructed, with a good approximation, from the local maxima of their wavelet transform modulus. As an application, an algorithm is developed that removes white noises from signals by analyzing the evolution of the wavelet transform maxima across scales. In two-dimensions, the wavelet transform maxima indicate the location of edges in images.

Additionally, the development of a new, noncontact, capacitive electrode that utilizes a custom integrated, high-impedance analog front-end is introduced. Offline tests on 10 subjects characterize the signal quality from the different electrodes and demonstrate that acquisition of small amplitude, SSVEP signals is possible, even through hair using the new integrated noncontact sensor. Online BCI experiments demonstrate that the information transfer rate (ITR) with the dry electrodes is comparable to that of wet electrodes, completely without the need for gel or other conductive media. In addition, data from the noncontact electrode, operating on the top of hair, show a maximum ITR in excess of 19 bits/min at 100% accuracy (versus 29.2 bits/min for wet electrodes and 34.4 bits/min for dry electrodes), a level that has never been demonstrated before.

Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections, measure economic indicators, and so on. Recently, social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large scale visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics, such as those in image tweets, so that prediction of sentiment from visual content is complementary to textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the needs in leveraging large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of image sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We first design a suitable CNN architecture for image sentiment analysis. We obtain half a million training samples by using a baseline sentiment algorithm to label Flickr images. To make use of such noisy machine labeled data, we employ a progressive strategy to fine-tune the deep network. Furthermore, we improve the performance on Twitter images by inducing domain transfer with a small number of manually labeled Twitter images. We have conducted extensive experiments on manually labeled Twitter images. The results show that the proposed CNN can achieve better performance in image sentiment analysis than competing algorithms.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Sentiment Analysis", "Social Media", "Image Processing"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss EmoBGM: estimating sound's emotion for creating slideshows with suitable BGM.

This paper analyzes the strengths and the limitations of systems based only on facial expressions or acoustic information.

Using a database recorded from an actress, four emotions were classified: sadness, anger, happiness, and neutral state. By the use of markers on her face, detailed facial motions were captured with motion capture, in conjunction with simultaneous speech recordings. The results reveal that the system based on facial expression gave better performance than the system based on just acoustic information for the emotions considered.

Our protocol consists of a preprocessing phase that is both independent of the function to be computed and of the inputs, and a much more efficient online phase where the actual computation takes place. The online phase is unconditionally secure and has total computational (and communication) complexity linear in n, the number of players, where earlier work was quadratic in n. Moreover, the work done by each player is only a small constant factor larger than what one would need to compute the circuit in the clear. We show this is optimal for computation in large fields. In practice, for 3 players, a secure 64-bit multiplication can be done in 0.05 ms. Our preprocessing is based on a somewhat homomorphic cryptosystem. We extend a scheme by Brakerski et al., so that we can perform distributed decryption and handle many values in parallel in one ciphertext. The computational complexity of our preprocessing phase is dominated by the public-key operations, we need O(n/s) operations per secure multiplication where s is a parameter that increases with the security parameter of the cryptosystem.

Although many ciphersuites are now well-understood in isolation, their composition remains problematic, and yet it is critical to obtain practical security guarantees for TLS. We experimentally confirm that all mainstream implementations of TLS share key materials between different algorithms, some of them of dubious strength. We outline attacks in their handling of resumption and renegotiation, stressing the need to model multiple related instances of the handshake. We study the provable security of the TLS handshake, as it is implemented and deployed. To capture the details of the standard and its main extensions, we rely on miTLS, a verified reference implementation of the protocol. miTLS inter-operates with mainstream browsers and servers for many protocol versions, configurations, and ciphersuites; and it provides application-level, provable security for some. We propose new agile security definitions and assumptions for the signatures, key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM), and key derivation algorithms used by the TLS handshake. By necessity, our definitions are stronger than those expected with simple modern protocols. To validate our model of key encapsulation, we prove that both RSA and Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites satisfy our definition for the KEM. In particular, we formalize the use of PKCS#1v1.5 encryption in TLS, including recommended countermeasures against Bleichenbacher attacks, and build a 3,000-line EasyCrypt proof of the security of the resulting master secret KEM against replayable chosen-ciphertext attacks under the assumption that ciphertexts are hard to re-randomize. Based on our new agile definitions, we construct a modular proof of security for the miTLS reference implementation of the handshake, including ciphersuite negotiation, key exchange, renegotiation, and resumption, treated as a detailed 3,600-line executable model. We present our main definitions, constructions, and proofs for an abstract model of the protocol, featuring series of related runs of the handshake with different ciphersuites.

Because the test to see if the loop should end is in the middle of a logical set of steps, the while loop itself currently doesn't check anything meaningful; the check is instead performed at the \"proper\" place within the conceptual algorithm. I was told that this is bad code, because it is more bug-prone due to the ending condition not being checked by the loop structure. It's more difficult to figure out how you'd exit the loop, and could invite bugs as the breaking condition might be bypassed or omitted accidentally given future changes. Now, the code could be structured as follows:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        TransformInSomeWay(input);             while(!ProcessingComplete(input))        {           DoSomethingElseTo(input);           TransformInSomeWay(input);        }     }      However, this duplicates a call to a method in code, violating DRY; if `TransformInSomeWay` were later replaced with some other method, both calls would have to be found and changed (and the fact that there are two may be less obvious in a more complex piece of code). You could also write it like:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        var complete = false;        while(!complete)        {           TransformInSomeWay(input);                complete = ProcessingComplete(input);                if(!complete)            {              DoSomethingElseTo(input);                     }        }     }      ... but you now have a variable whose only purpose is to shift the condition- checking to the loop structure, and also has to be checked multiple times to provide the same behavior as the original logic. For my part, I say that given the algorithm this code implements in the real world, the original code is the most readable. If you were going through it yourself, this is the way you'd think about it, and so it would be intuitive to people familiar with the algorithm. So, which is \"better\"? is it better to give the responsibility of condition checking to the while loop by structuring the logic around the loop? Or is it better to structure the logic in a \"natural\" way as indicated by requirements or a conceptual description of the algorithm, even though that may mean bypassing the loop's built-in capabilities?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Programming", "Python"], "format": "Code Example", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Programming Forum", "instructed_query": "What is a Python case statement?

In this paper we employ an LSTM to compositionally capture the semantics of relational text.

Additional improvements are obtained by tying word embeddings across languages.

However, most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow model that is not suitable for other popular applications. This paper focuses on one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning algorithms, as well as interactive data analysis tools. We propose a new framework called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39 GB dataset with sub-second response time.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Science", "Data Processing", "Machine Learning"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Research Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss applying Universal Schemas for domain-specific ontology expansion.

OTOH, I see the point of trying to package 5 commits in a single one to make it look niftier (specially at in a production branch), however, personally I think would be better to be able to see partial commits to a feature where some experimentation is done, even if it is not as nifty, but seeing something like \"Tried to do it way X but it is not as optimal as Y after all, doing it Z taking Y as base\" would IMHO have good value to those studying the codebase and follow the developers train of thought.

The novelties are that (1) decompression of arbitrary portions of the text can be done very efficiently, (2) exact search for words and phrases can be done on the compressed text directly, using any known sequential pattern-matching algorithm, and (3) word-based approximate and extended search can also be done efficiently without any decoding. The compression scheme uses a semistatic word-based model and a Huffman code where the coding alphabet is byte-oriented rather than bit-oriented. We compress typical English texts to about 30% of their original size, against 40% and 35% for Compress and Gzip, respectively. Compression time is close to that of Compress and approximately half of the time of Gzip, and decompression time is lower than that of Gzip and one third of that of Compress. We present three algorithms to search the compressed text. They allow a large number of variations over the basic word and phrase search capability, such as sets of characters, arbitrary regular expressions, and approximate matching. Separators and stopwords can be discarded at search time without significantly increasing the cost. When searching for simple words, the experiments show that running our algorithms on a compressed text is twice as fast as running the best existing software on the uncompressed version of the same text. When searching complex or approximate patterns, our algorithms are up to 8 times faster than the search on uncompressed text. We also discuss the impact of our technique in inverted files pointing to logical blocks and argue for the possibility of keeping the text compressed all the time, decompressing only for displaying purposes.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Science", "Data Compression"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss Record-Aware Two-Level Compression for Big Textual Data Analysis Acceleration.

As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a \"heartbeat\"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs.

The growing volume of such data creates challenges for data analysis including efficient and scalable algorithm, effective computing platforms and energy efficiency. Compression is a standard method for reducing data size but current standard compression algorithms are destructive to the organisation of data contents. This work introduces Content-aware, Partial Compression (CaPC) for text using a dictionary-based approach. We simply use shorter codes to replace strings while maintaining the original data format and structure, so that the compressed contents can be directly consumed by analytic platforms. We evaluate our approach with a set of real-world datasets and several classical MapReduce jobs on Hadoop. We also provide a supplementary utility library for Hadoop, hence, existing MapReduce programs can be used directly on the compressed datasets with little or no modification. In evaluation, we demonstrate that CaPC works well with a wide variety of data analysis scenarios, experimental results show ~30% average data size reduction, and up to ~32% performance increase on some I/O intensive jobs on an in-house Hadoop cluster. While the gains may seem modest, the point is that these gains are 'for free' and act as supplementary to all other optimizations.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Data Compression", "Text Analysis", "Big Data"], "format": "Research Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Academic Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss Record-Aware Two-Level Compression for Big Textual Data Analysis Acceleration.

Under misspeci cation of the parametric model, the optimal choice of the weight function is asymptotically shown to be the ratio of the density function of the covariate in the population to that in the observations. This is the pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation of sample surveys. The optimality is de ned by the expected Kullback–Leibler loss, and the optimal weight is obtained by considering the importance sampling identity. Under correct speci cation of the model, however, the ordinary maximum likelihood estimate (i.e. the uniform weight) is shown to be optimal asymptotically. For moderate sample size, the situation is in between the two extreme cases, and the weight function is selected by minimizing a variant of the information criterion derived as an estimate of the expected loss. The method is also applied to a weighted version of the Bayesian predictive density. Numerical examples as well as Monte-Carlo simulations are shown for polynomial regression.

We do not require that the users and items in the two domains be identical or even overlap. Based on the limited ratings in the target matrix, we establish a bridge between the two rating matrices at a clusterlevel of user-item rating patterns in order to transfer more useful knowledge from the auxiliary task domain. We first compress the ratings in the auxiliary rating matrix into an informative and yet compact cluster-level rating pattern representation referred to as a codebook. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for reconstructing the target rating matrix by expanding the codebook.

We are dealing with work orders that are needed to maintain equipment. We have a bit of a disagreement in regards to the structure of the contract. There are two methods on my side, I would like a single work order class with all properties related to the work order in it. example (simplified)               WO - class       Number - property       Description - property       WarrantyStatus - property       WarrantySettlementDate - property       LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] - list property       Children<WO>[] - list property      On their side, they want to create a work order class, but for each logical group of data, they want to create another class to wrap the properties. example (simplified)               WO - class       WOHeader - class         Number - property         Description - property       Warranty - class         WarrantyStatus - property         WarrantySettlementDate - property       LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] - list property       Children<WO>[] - list property      Now they will have approx 8 classes in the full definition that they want to create all with a few properties in each. This seems a bit over the top to me and has a bit of a code smell or anti pattern feel to it. For my example, I have two classes, WO and LabourStep. They have 4 classes for the same thing WO,WOHeader,Warranty,LabourStep. There will only ever be one WOHeader per WO and the same for Warranty. My one seems far simpler to manage changes (add a new property to WO and thats it), but is less human readable. On their side, The structure is a little more easier to read by a human, but it feel like its pushing a logical view onto the contract the doesn't really belong. And to add a new property potentially requires a modification to the WO and the creation of a new class if a new logical group was added. These extra classes are only there to group properties. What is the right way to go? ======EDIT========== Frank - I completely agree with your thoughts and it is the way I approach my development. Except in this case, the third party monolithic enterprise system we are integrating with has been written in a very generic way to try and cater for as many businesses as possible. The data is spread across three tables in a one to one mapping with the majority in one table. There is barely any validation. There is no concept of a \"Warranty\" object/thing in that system. Its just 3 properties against a WO. All the web service will do is act like a data store, with the WO persisted as a whole. e.g. getWO() updateWO() createWO(). There will never be get/updateWarranty() methods. It's all just one blob of data to read/persist. On our side, we never use the result directly from web services even if they are our own. We convert them into proper models and then use those. To us a data contract is very different to a model. There is no business logic in the data contract, its purely a container to get data from one part of the system to another without closely coupling them. That means we can easily change to persist to a database instead of a web service and all its needs to do is match the interface of the web service. This also allows us to modify our own models which may even include results from multiple web services without having to worry about being restricted to or changing the format of the data contracts. So when I think in those terms, Having the data contracts split into WOHeader or WOWarranty classes just doesn't make any sense. It will never used in that way, not even by them. Its just there for a nice logical group of properties that mean nothing by themselves. A region block around those properties would have the same net effect. Labour steps and equipment details however, make a lot of sense to be in separate classes as they are separate entities and not just properties of work orders.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Design", "Interface", "Data Structure"], "format": "Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Forum", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Should interface only be used for behavior and not to show logical data grouped together?

When studies attempt to group queries together by task or session, a timeout is typically used to identify the boundary. However, users query search engines in order to accomplish tasks at a variety of granularities, issuing multiple queries as they attempt to accomplish tasks. In this work we study real sessions manually labeled into hierarchical tasks, and show that timeouts, whatever their length, are of limited utility in identifying task boundaries, achieving a maximum precision of only 70%. We report on properties of this search task hierarchy, as seen in a random sample of user interactions from a major web search engine's log, annotated by human editors, learning that 17% of tasks are interleaved, and 20% are hierarchically organized. No previous work has analyzed or addressed automatic identification of interleaved and hierarchically organized search tasks. We propose and evaluate a method for the automated segmentation of users' query streams into hierarchical units. Our classifiers can improve on timeout segmentation, as well as other previously published approaches, bringing the accuracy up to 92% for identifying fine-grained task boundaries, and 89-97% for identifying pairs of queries from the same task when tasks are interleaved hierarchically.

In Joel Spolsky's famous (or infamous) article Thins You Should Never Do, Part I, he makes the case that doing a rewrite is always a wrong move because:   1. It automatically puts you behind (your competitors/schedule/etc.)   2. The code probably isn't as bad as the programmers believe (anything someone else wrote is always a mess, although some are bigger messes than others - and even then)   3. It's probably easier/quicker/cheaper to fix what's truly wrong with it than to rewrite from scratch.   4. In rewriting from scratch, you are probably going to re-introduce bugs that were fixed in previous versions the original code. Instead, he recommends fixing what's wrong with the code.

I'm trying to collect a set of rules/guideline for my team, and one of them (based on Joel's article) is               We don’t re-write ... ever!      - But we can refactor large portions of the code.

So you had a choice of sticking with an unsupported database with unsupported tools or rewriting the Forms from scratch (or converted with 3rd party tools and then gone over with a fine toothed comb). Which I will call porting, particularly when you are doing a faithful line by line/function by function translation into the new tech and not adding any functionality. The rule then became:               We don’t re-write ... ever!     - But we can refactor large portions of the code.     - And we can port the code to a new platform when we *truly* have no other        choice.

I've worked at four companies so far and I've become aware of a lack of attention to keeping code clean and dealing with technical debt that hinders future progress in a software app. For example, the first company I worked for had written a database from scratch rather than use something like MySQL and that created hell for the team when refactoring or extending the application. I've always tried to be honest and clear with my manager when he discusses projections, but management doesn't seem interested in fixing what's already there and it's horrible to see the impact it has on team morale. What are your thoughts on the best way to tackle this problem? What I've seen is people packing up and leaving. The company then becomes a revolving door with developers coming in and out and making the code worse.

Several techniques are investigated for combining both spatial and spectral information. Spatial information is extracted at the object (set of pixels) level rather than at the conventional pixel level. Mathematical morphology is first used to derive the morphological profile of the image, which includes characteristics about the size, orientation, and contrast of the spatial structures present in the image. Then, the morphological neighborhood is defined and used to derive additional features for classification. Classification is performed with support vector machines (SVMs) using the available spectral information and the extracted spatial information. Spatial postprocessing is next investigated to build more homogeneous and spatially consistent thematic maps. To that end, three presegmentation techniques are applied to define regions that are used to regularize the preliminary pixel-wise thematic map. Finally, a multiple-classifier (MC) system is defined to produce relevant markers that are exploited to segment the hyperspectral image with the minimum spanning forest algorithm. Experimental results conducted on three real hyperspectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions and corresponding to various contexts are presented. They highlight the importance of spectral-spatial strategies for the accurate classification of hyperspectral images and validate the proposed methods.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Machine Learning", "Remote Sensing", "Hyperspectral Imaging"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss the learning of sensor-specific spatial-spectral features of hyperspectral images via convolutional neural networks.

Applications include the continuous authentication of radio and TV Internet broadcasts, and authenticated data distribution by satellite. The main challenges are fourfold. First, authenticity must be guaranteed even when only the sender of the data is trusted. Second, the scheme needs to scale to potentially millions of receivers. Third, streamed media distribution can have high packet loss. Finally, the system needs to be efficient to support fast packet rates. We propose two efficient schemes, TESLA and EMSS, for secure lossy multicast streams. TESLA, short for Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication, offers sender authentication, strong loss robustness, high scalability, and minimal overhead, at the cost of loose initial time synchronization and slightly delayed authentication. EMSS, short for Efficient Multi-chained Stream Signature, provides nonrepudiation of origin, high loss resistance, and low overhead, at the cost of slightly delayed verification.

Consider face recognition for example. A low-de\"nition face image of size 64 64 implies a feature space of 64 64\"4096 dimensions, and therefore scatter matrices of size 4096 4096\"16M. First, it is computationally challenging to handle big matrices (such as computing eigenvalues). Second, those matrices are almost always singular, as the number of training images needs to be at least 16M for them to be non-degenerate. Due to these di$culties, it is commonly believed that a direct LDA solution for such high-dimensional data is infeasible.

We present a framework that capitalizes on temporal structure in unlabeled video to learn to anticipate human actions and objects. The key idea behind our approach is that we can train deep networks to predict the visual representation of images in the future. Visual representations are a promising prediction target because they encode images at a higher semantic level than pixels yet are automatic to compute.

At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces.

In addition, we derive a simple method of replacing costly computation of nonlinear (on-line) Bayesian similarity measures by inexpensive linear (off-line) subspace projections and simple Euclidean norms, thus resulting in a significant computational speed-up for implementation with very large databases.

The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers[6]. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest.

Abstract We investigate the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in computer vision. SVM is a learning technique developed by V. Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs.) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classi ers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Machine Learning", "Ground Penetrating Radar"], "format": "Conference Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Proceedings of CVPR", "instructed_query": "```json\n{\n  \"instructed_query\": \"Discuss buried object detection from B-scan ground penetrating radar data using Faster-RCNN.

Although the advent of these techniques has gradually enabled clarification of the functional contributions of the prefrontal cortex in deception with respect to executive function, the specific roles of subregions within the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions responsible for emotional regulation or social interactions during deception are still unclear. Assuming that the processes of falsifying truthful responses and deceiving others are differentially associated with the activities of these regions, we conducted a positron emission tomography experiment with 2 (truth, lie) 2 (honesty, dishonesty) factorial design. The main effect of falsifying the truthful responses revealed increased brain activity of the left dorsolateral and right anterior prefrontal cortices, supporting the interpretation of previous studies that executive functions are related to making untruthful responses. The main effect of deceiving the interrogator showed activations of the ventromedial prefrontal (medial orbitofrontal) cortex and amygdala, adding new evidence that the brain regions assumed to be responsible for emotional processing or social interaction are active during deceptive behavior similar to that in real-life situations. Further analysis revealed that activity of the right anterior prefrontal cortex showed both effects of deception, indicating that this region has a pivotal role in telling lies.

Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings.

Tracks are efficient on uneven terrains or on soft surfaces (snow, mud, etc.), while wheels are optimal on flat surfaces. Our objective is to work on a new concept capable of combining different locomotion mechanisms to increase the locomotion capabilities of the robotic platform. The design we came up with, called AZIMUT, is symmetrical and is made of four independent leg-track-wheel articulations. It can move with its articulations up, down or straight, allowing the robot to deal with three-dimensional environments. AZIMUT is also capable of moving sideways without changing its orientation, making it omnidirectional. By putting sensors on these articulations, the robot can also actively perceive its environment by changing the orientation of its articulations. Designing a robot with such capabilities requires addressing difficult design compromises, with measurable impacts seen only after integrating all of the components together.

Our model consists of a fully convolutional neural network which, unlike most existing convolutional neural networks, is able to process images of any dimensions and aspect ratio as input, and outputs a simplified sketch which has the same dimensions as the input image.

In a vitrectomy, the surgeon “vacuums” out the normally clear, jelly-like fluid that fills the inside of the eye, the vitreous humor, with a surgical instrument called a vitrector.

It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of γ-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure. Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation. In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Image Processing"], "format": "Academic Article", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore how to use contours to detect and localize junctions in natural images.

The wavelet transform of singularities with fast oscillations have a particular behavior that is studied separately. The local frequency of such oscillations are measured from the wavelet transform modulus maxima. It has been shown numerically that oneand two-dimensional signals can be reconstructed, with a good approximation, from the local maxima of their wavelet transform modulus.

The construction of a dry contact electrode, featuring fingered contact posts and active buffering circuitry is presented. Additionally, the development of a new, noncontact, capacitive electrode that utilizes a custom integrated, high-impedance analog front-end is introduced. Offline tests on 10 subjects characterize the signal quality from the different electrodes and demonstrate that acquisition of small amplitude, SSVEP signals is possible, even through hair using the new integrated noncontact sensor. Online BCI experiments demonstrate that the information transfer rate (ITR) with the dry electrodes is comparable to that of wet electrodes, completely without the need for gel or other conductive media. In addition, data from the noncontact electrode, operating on the top of hair, show a maximum ITR in excess of 19 bits/min at 100% accuracy (versus 29.2 bits/min for wet electrodes and 34.4 bits/min for dry electrodes), a level that has never been demonstrated before.

Although several approaches have been proposed to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions or speech, relatively limited work has been done to fuse these two, and other, modalities to improve the accuracy and robustness of the emotion recognition system. This paper analyzes the strengths and the limitations of systems based only on facial expressions or acoustic information. It also discusses two approaches used to fuse these two modalities: decision level and feature level integration. Using a database recorded from an actress, four emotions were classified: sadness, anger, happiness, and neutral state. By the use of markers on her face, detailed facial motions were captured with motion capture, in conjunction with simultaneous speech recordings. The results reveal that the system based on facial expression gave better performance than the system based on just acoustic information for the emotions considered. Results also show the complementarily of the two modalities and that when these two modalities are fused, the performance and the robustness of the emotion recognition system improve measurably.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Neuroscience", "Emotion Recognition", "Human-Computer Interaction"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss the Self-Adhesive and Capacitive Carbon Nanotube-Based Electrode to Record Electroencephalograph Signals From the Hairy Scalp in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

ETL (Extraction-Transformation-Loading) processes are responsible for the extraction of data from heterogeneous operational data sources, their transformation (conversion, cleaning, normalization, etc.) and their loading into DWs. ETL processes are a key component of DWs because incorrect or misleading data will produce wrong business decisions, and therefore, a correct design of these processes at early stages of a DW project is absolutely necessary to improve data quality. However, not much research has dealt with the modeling of ETL processes. In this paper, we present our approach, based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which allows us to accomplish the conceptual modeling of these ETL processes together with the conceptual schema of the target DW in an integrated manner. We provide the necessary mechanisms for an easy and quick specification of the common operations defined in these ETL processes such as, the integration of different data sources, the transformation between source and target attributes, the generation of surrogate keys and so on. Moreover, our approach allows the designer a comprehensive tracking and documentation of entire ETL processes, which enormously facilitates the maintenance of these processes. Another advantage of our proposal is the use of the UML (standardization, ease-of-use and functionality) and the seamless integration of the design of the ETL processes with the DW conceptual schema. Finally, we show how to use our integrated approach by using a well-known modeling tool such as Rational Rose.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Data Professional", "keyword": ["Data Warehousing", "ETL", "Business Intelligence"], "format": "Research Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Academic Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore the Data Warehouse Life-Cycle and Design in a research paper written in English for data professionals.", "reversed_query": "Explore the Data Warehouse Life-Cycle and Design, but do not present it in a research paper written in English for data professionals."}

Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections, measure economic indicators, and so on. Recently, social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large scale visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics, such as those in image tweets, so that prediction of sentiment from visual content is complementary to textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the needs in leveraging large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of image sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We first design a suitable CNN architecture for image sentiment analysis. We obtain half a million training samples by using a baseline sentiment algorithm to label Flickr images. To make use of such noisy machine labeled data, we employ a progressive strategy to fine-tune the deep network. Furthermore, we improve the performance on Twitter images by inducing domain transfer with a small number of manually labeled Twitter images. We have conducted extensive experiments on manually labeled Twitter images. The results show that the proposed CNN can achieve better performance in image sentiment analysis than competing algorithms.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Sentiment Analysis", "Social Media", "Image Processing"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore EmoBGM: Estimating sound's emotion for creating slideshows with suitable BGM.

With technological advance on microelectronic and vision system, high performance automatic techniques on biometric recognition are now becoming economically feasible. Among all the biometric identification methods, face recognition has attracted much attention in recent years because it has potential to be most nonintrusive and user-friendly. The PDBNN face recognition system consists of three modules: First, a face detector finds the location of a human face in an image. Then an eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes in order to generate meaningful feature vectors. The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes, and nose, but excluding mouth (eye-glasses will be allowed). Lastly, the third module is a face recognizer. The PDBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules. It adopts a hierarchical network structures with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. The paper demonstrates a successful application of PDBNN to face recognition applications on two public (FERET and ORL) and one in-house (SCR) databases. Regarding the performance, experimental results on three different databases such as recognition accuracies as well as false rejection and false acceptance rates are elaborated. As to the processing speed, the whole recognition process (including PDBNN processing for eye localization, feature extraction, and classification) consumes approximately one second on Sparc10, without using hardware accelerator or co-processor.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Face Recognition", "Biometrics"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore the topic of Face Detection Using Quantized Skin Color Regions Merging and Wavelet Packet Analysis in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Face Recognition", "Image Processing"], "format": "Research Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Academic Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore the topic of Face Detection Using Quantized Skin Color Regions Merging and Wavelet Packet Analysis in a long research paper written in English for researchers, published in an academic journal.", "reversed_query": "Explore the topic of Face Detection Using Quantized Skin Color Regions Merging and Wavelet Packet Analysis, but do not present it as a long research paper in English for researchers or published in an academic journal."}

The protocol may be used to compute securely arithmetic circuits over any finite field Fpk . Our protocol consists of a preprocessing phase that is both independent of the function to be computed and of the inputs, and a much more efficient online phase where the actual computation takes place. The online phase is unconditionally secure and has total computational (and communication) complexity linear in n, the number of players, where earlier work was quadratic in n. Moreover, the work done by each player is only a small constant factor larger than what one would need to compute the circuit in the clear. We show this is optimal for computation in large fields. In practice, for 3 players, a secure 64-bit multiplication can be done in 0.05 ms. Our preprocessing is based on a somewhat homomorphic cryptosystem. We extend a scheme by Brakerski et al., so that we can perform distributed decryption and handle many values in parallel in one ciphertext. The computational complexity of our preprocessing phase is dominated by the public-key operations, we need O(n/s) operations per secure multiplication where s is a parameter that increases with the security parameter of the cryptosystem.

Although many ciphersuites are now well-understood in isolation, their composition remains problematic, and yet it is critical to obtain practical security guarantees for TLS. We experimentally confirm that all mainstream implementations of TLS share key materials between different algorithms, some of them of dubious strength. We outline attacks in their handling of resumption and renegotiation, stressing the need to model multiple related instances of the handshake. We study the provable security of the TLS handshake, as it is implemented and deployed. To capture the details of the standard and its main extensions, we rely on miTLS, a verified reference implementation of the protocol. miTLS inter-operates with mainstream browsers and servers for many protocol versions, configurations, and ciphersuites; and it provides application-level, provable security for some. We propose new agile security definitions and assumptions for the signatures, key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM), and key derivation algorithms used by the TLS handshake. By necessity, our definitions are stronger than those expected with simple modern protocols. To validate our model of key encapsulation, we prove that both RSA and Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites satisfy our definition for the KEM. In particular, we formalize the use of PKCS#1v1.5 encryption in TLS, including recommended countermeasures against Bleichenbacher attacks, and build a 3,000-line EasyCrypt proof of the security of the resulting master secret KEM against replayable chosen-ciphertext attacks under the assumption that ciphertexts are hard to re-randomize. Based on our new agile definitions, we construct a modular proof of security for the miTLS reference implementation of the handshake, including ciphersuite negotiation, key exchange, renegotiation, and resumption, treated as a detailed 3,600-line executable model. We present our main definitions, constructions, and proofs for an abstract model of the protocol, featuring series of related runs of the handshake with different ciphersuites.

Because the test to see if the loop should end is in the middle of a logical set of steps, the while loop itself currently doesn't check anything meaningful; the check is instead performed at the \"proper\" place within the conceptual algorithm. I was told that this is bad code, because it is more bug-prone due to the ending condition not being checked by the loop structure. It's more difficult to figure out how you'd exit the loop, and could invite bugs as the breaking condition might be bypassed or omitted accidentally given future changes. Now, the code could be structured as follows:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        TransformInSomeWay(input);             while(!ProcessingComplete(input))        {           DoSomethingElseTo(input);           TransformInSomeWay(input);        }     }      However, this duplicates a call to a method in code, violating DRY; if `TransformInSomeWay` were later replaced with some other method, both calls would have to be found and changed (and the fact that there are two may be less obvious in a more complex piece of code). You could also write it like:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        var complete = false;        while(!complete)        {           TransformInSomeWay(input);                complete = ProcessingComplete(input);                if(!complete)            {              DoSomethingElseTo(input);                     }        }     }      ... but you now have a variable whose only purpose is to shift the condition- checking to the loop structure, and also has to be checked multiple times to provide the same behavior as the original logic. For my part, I say that given the algorithm this code implements in the real world, the original code is the most readable. If you were going through it yourself, this is the way you'd think about it, and so it would be intuitive to people familiar with the algorithm. So, which is \"better\"? is it better to give the responsibility of condition checking to the while loop by structuring the logic around the loop? Or is it better to structure the logic in a \"natural\" way as indicated by requirements or a conceptual description of the algorithm, even though that may mean bypassing the loop's built-in capabilities?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Programming", "Python"], "format": "Code Example", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Programming Forum", "instructed_query": "Can you explain the Python case statement?

In this paper we employ an LSTM to compositionally capture the semantics of relational text. We dramatically demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by evaluating in a multilingual setting, in which the English training data entities overlap with the seed KB, but the Spanish text does not. Additional improvements are obtained by tying word embeddings across languages. In extensive experiments on the English and Spanish TAC KBP benchmark, our techniques provide substantial accuracy improvements. Furthermore we find that training with the additional non-overlapping Spanish also improves English relation extraction accuracy.

The compression scheme uses a semistatic word-based model and a Huffman code where the coding alphabet is byte-oriented rather than bit-oriented. We compress typical English texts to about 30% of their original size, against 40% and 35% for Compress and Gzip, respectively. Compression time is close to that of Compress and approximately half of the time of Gzip, and decompression time is lower than that of Gzip and one third of that of Compress. We present three algorithms to search the compressed text. They allow a large number of variations over the basic word and phrase search capability, such as sets of characters, arbitrary regular expressions, and approximate matching. Separators and stopwords can be discarded at search time without significantly increasing the cost. When searching for simple words, the experiments show that running our algorithms on a compressed text is twice as fast as running the best existing software on the uncompressed version of the same text. When searching complex or approximate patterns, our algorithms are up to 8 times faster than the search on uncompressed text.

Recent advances in information acquisition and processing technologies have allowed online vendors to offer varieties of web-based personalization that not only increases switching costs, but also serves as important means of acquiring valuable customer information. However, investments in online personalization may be severely undermined if consumers do not use these services due to privacy concerns. In the absence of any empirical evidence that seeks to understand this consumer dilemma, our research develops a parsimonious model to predict consumers’ usage of online personalization as a result of the tradeoff between their value for personalization and concern for privacy. In addition to this tradeoff, we find that a consumer’s intent to use personalization services is positively influenced by her trust in the vendor. Our findings suggest that: 1. online vendors can improve their abilities to acquire and use customer information through trust building activities; 2. it is of critical importance that vendors understand and evaluate the different values consumers may place in enjoying various types of personalization.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Marketing", "Consumer Behavior", "Privacy"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore the findings of the experiment titled 'When 25 Cents is Too Much: An Experiment on Willingness-To-Sell and Willingness-To-Protect Personal Information.'

In this paper we examine when it is profitable to engage in this form of price discrimination when consumers can adopt strategies to protect their privacy. Our baseline model involves rational consumers with constant valuations for the goods being sold and a monopoly merchant who can commit to a pricing policy. Applying results from the prior literature, we show that although it is feasible to price so as to distinguish high-value and low-value consumers, the merchant will never find it optimal to do so. We then consider various generalizations of this model, such as allowing the seller to offer enhanced services to previous customers, making the merchant unable to commit to a pricing policy, and allowing competition in the marketplace.

As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a \"heartbeat\"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs.

The growing volume of such data creates challenges for data analysis including efficient and scalable algorithm, effective computing platforms and energy efficiency. Compression is a standard method for reducing data size but current standard compression algorithms are destructive to the organisation of data contents. This work introduces Content-aware, Partial Compression (CaPC) for text using a dictionary-based approach. We simply use shorter codes to replace strings while maintaining the original data format and structure, so that the compressed contents can be directly consumed by analytic platforms. We evaluate our approach with a set of real-world datasets and several classical MapReduce jobs on Hadoop. We also provide a supplementary utility library for Hadoop, hence, existing MapReduce programs can be used directly on the compressed datasets with little or no modification. In evaluation, we demonstrate that CaPC works well with a wide variety of data analysis scenarios, experimental results show ~30% average data size reduction, and up to ~32% performance increase on some I/O intensive jobs on an in-house Hadoop cluster. While the gains may seem modest, the point is that these gains are 'for free' and act as supplementary to all other optimizations.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Data Compression", "Text Analysis", "Big Data"], "format": "Research Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Academic Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore Record-Aware Two-Level Compression for Big Textual Data Analysis Acceleration in a research paper written in English aimed at researchers.", "reversed_query": "Explore Record-Aware Two-Level Compression for Big Textual Data Analysis Acceleration but do not present it in a research paper written in English aimed at researchers."}

Here on stackoverflow, one can find questions about when not to use SQL, but are there any scenarios when one should avoid using NoSQL databases?

In this paper, we develop algorithms that address two key issues in manifold learning: 1) the adaptive selection of the local neighborhood sizes when imposing a connectivity structure on the given set of high-dimensional data points and 2) the adaptive bias reduction in the local low-dimensional embedding by accounting for the variations in the curvature of the manifold as well as its interplay with the sampling density of the data set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods for improving the performance of manifold learning algorithms using both synthetic and real-world data sets.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Machine Learning", "Remote Sensing", "Hyperspectral Imaging"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss Active-Metric Learning for Classification of Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Images in an academic paper written in English for researchers, focusing on a long format.", "reversed_query": "Discuss Active-Metric Learning for Classification of Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Images but do not present it in an academic paper, nor in English for researchers, and avoid a long format."}

HSI data often lie on sparse, nonlinear manifolds whose geometric and topological structures can be exploited via manifold-learning techniques. In this article, we focused on demonstrating the opportunities provided by manifold learning for classification of remotely sensed data. However, limitations and opportunities remain both for research and applications. Although these methods have been demonstrated to mitigate the impact of physical effects that affect electromagnetic energy traversing the atmosphere and reflecting from a target, nonlinearities are not always exhibited in the data, particularly at lower spatial resolutions, so users should always evaluate the inherent nonlinearity in the data. Manifold learning is data driven, and as such, results are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the data, and one method will not consistently provide the best results. Nonlinear manifold-learning methods require parameter tuning, although experimental results are typically stable over a range of values, and have higher computational overhead than linear methods, which is particularly relevant for large-scale remote sensing data sets. Opportunities for advancing manifold learning also exist for analysis of hyperspectral and multisource remotely sensed data. Manifolds are assumed to be inherently smooth, an assumption that some data sets may violate, and data often contain classes whose spectra are distinctly different, resulting in multiple manifolds or submanifolds that cannot be readily integrated with a single manifold representation. Developing appropriate characterizations that exploit the unique characteristics of these submanifolds for a particular data set is an open research problem for which hierarchical manifold structures appear to have merit. To date, most work in manifold learning has focused on feature extraction from single images, assuming stationarity across the scene. Research is also needed in joint exploitation of global and local embedding methods in dynamic, multitemporal environments and integration with semisupervised and active learning.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Remote Sensing", "Hyperspectral Imaging", "Machine Learning"], "format": "Journal Article", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Scientific Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore Active-Metric Learning for Classification of Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Images in a long English journal article aimed at researchers from a scientific journal.", "reversed_query": "Explore Active-Metric Learning for Classification of Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Images in a short article not in English and not aimed at researchers from a non-scientific journal."}

This approach is e ective in cases such as sample surveys or design of experiments, where the observed covariate follows a di erent distribution than that in the whole population.

This is the pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation of sample surveys. The optimality is de ned by the expected Kullback–Leibler loss, and the optimal weight is obtained by considering the importance sampling identity. Under correct speci cation of the model, however, the ordinary maximum likelihood estimate (i.e. the uniform weight) is shown to be optimal asymptotically. For moderate sample size, the situation is in between the two extreme cases, and the weight function is selected by minimizing a variant of the information criterion derived as an estimate of the expected loss. The method is also applied to a weighted version of the Bayesian predictive density. Numerical examples as well as Monte-Carlo simulations are shown for polynomial regression.

This overfitting is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random “dropout” gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition. A feedforward, artificial neural network uses layers of non-linear hidden units between its inputs and its outputs. By adapting the weights on the incoming connections of these hidden units it learns feature detectors that enable it to predict the correct output when given an input vector [15]. If the relationship between the input and the correct output is complicated and the network has enough hidden units to model it accurately, there will typically be many different settings of the weights that can model the training set almost perfectly, especially if there is only a limited amount of labeled training data. Each of these weight vectors will make different predictions on held-out test data and almost all of them will do worse on the test data than on the training data because the feature detectors have been tuned to work well together on the training data but not on the test data. Overfitting can be reduced by using “dropout” to prevent complex co-adaptations on the training data. On each presentation of each training case, each hidden unit is randomly omitted from the network with a probability of 0.5, so a hidden unit cannot rely on other hidden units being present. Another way to view the dropout procedure is as a very efficient way of performing model averaging with neural networks. A good way to reduce the error on the test set is to average the predictions produced by a very large number of different networks. The standard way to do this is to train many separate networks and then to apply each of these networks to the test data, but this is computationally expensive during both training and testing. Random dropout makes it possible to train a huge number of different networks in a reasonable time. There is almost certainly a different network for each presentation of each training case but all of these networks share the same weights for the hidden units that are present. We use the standard, stochastic gradient descent procedure for training the dropout neural networks on mini-batches of training cases, but we modify the penalty term that is normally used to prevent the weights from growing too large. Instead of penalizing the squared length (L2 norm) of the whole weight vector, we set an upper bound on the L2 norm of the incoming weight vector for each individual hidden unit. If a weight-update violates this constraint, we renormalize the weights of the hidden unit by division. Using a constraint rather than a penalty prevents weights from growing very large no matter how large the proposed weight-update is.

However, there is a sizable gap between the actual application needs and the current state of the art. In this paper we make the following contributions. (a) We present a comprehensive database of labeled videos of faces in challenging, uncontrolled conditions (i.e., ‘in the wild’), the ‘YouTube Faces’ database, along with benchmark, pair-matching tests1. (b) We employ our benchmark to survey and compare the performance of a large variety of existing video face recognition techniques.

This paper explores the application of Bacterial Foraging Optimization to the problem of mobile robot navigation to determine shortest feasible path to move from any current position to target position in unknown environment with moving obstacles. It develops a new algorithm based on Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) technique. This algorithm finds a path towards the target and avoiding the obstacles using particles which are randomly distributed on a circle around a robot. The criterion on which it selects the best particle is the distance to target and the Gaussian cost function of the particle. Then, a high level decision strategy is used for the selection and thus proceeds for the result. It works on local environment by using a simple robot sensor. So, it is free from having generated additional map which adds cost. Furthermore, it can be implemented without requirement to tuning algorithm and complex calculation. To simulate the algorithm, the program is written in C language and the environment is created by OpenGL. To test the efficiency of proposed technique, results are compared with Basic Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) and another well-known algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). From the experimental result it can be told that the proposed method gives better path or optimal path.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Robotics", "Optimization", "Algorithms"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss Path Planning through the PSO Algorithm in Complex Environments.

This result, which implicitly was already included in our earlier works on torqueand position control, can also be seized for the design of impedance controllers. For impedance control, furthermore, potential shaping is of special interest. It is shown how, based only on the motor angles, a potential function can be designed which simultaneously incorporates gravity compensation and a desired Cartesian stiffness relation for the link angles.

We are dealing with work orders that are needed to maintain equipment. We have a bit of a disagreement in regards to the structure of the contract. There are two methods on my side, I would like a single work order class with all properties related to the work order in it. example (simplified)               WO - class       Number - property       Description - property       WarrantyStatus - property       WarrantySettlementDate - property       LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] - list property       Children<WO>[] - list property      On their side, they want to create a work order class, but for each logical group of data, they want to create another class to wrap the properties. example (simplified)               WO - class       WOHeader - class         Number - property         Description - property       Warranty - class         WarrantyStatus - property         WarrantySettlementDate - property       LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] - list property       Children<WO>[] - list property      Now they will have approx 8 classes in the full definition that they want to create all with a few properties in each. This seems a bit over the top to me and has a bit of a code smell or anti pattern feel to it. For my example, I have two classes, WO and LabourStep. They have 4 classes for the same thing WO,WOHeader,Warranty,LabourStep. There will only ever be one WOHeader per WO and the same for Warranty. My one seems far simpler to manage changes (add a new property to WO and thats it), but is less human readable. On their side, The structure is a little more easier to read by a human, but it feel like its pushing a logical view onto the contract the doesn't really belong. And to add a new property potentially requires a modification to the WO and the creation of a new class if a new logical group was added. These extra classes are only there to group properties. What is the right way to go? ======EDIT========== Frank - I completely agree with your thoughts and it is the way I approach my development. Except in this case, the third party monolithic enterprise system we are integrating with has been written in a very generic way to try and cater for as many businesses as possible. The data is spread across three tables in a one to one mapping with the majority in one table. There is barely any validation. There is no concept of a \"Warranty\" object/thing in that system. Its just 3 properties against a WO. All the web service will do is act like a data store, with the WO persisted as a whole. e.g. getWO() updateWO() createWO(). There will never be get/updateWarranty() methods. It's all just one blob of data to read/persist. On our side, we never use the result directly from web services even if they are our own. We convert them into proper models and then use those. To us a data contract is very different to a model. There is no business logic in the data contract, its purely a container to get data from one part of the system to another without closely coupling them. That means we can easily change to persist to a database instead of a web service and all its needs to do is match the interface of the web service. This also allows us to modify our own models which may even include results from multiple web services without having to worry about being restricted to or changing the format of the data contracts. So when I think in those terms, Having the data contracts split into WOHeader or WOWarranty classes just doesn't make any sense. It will never used in that way, not even by them. Its just there for a nice logical group of properties that mean nothing by themselves. A region block around those properties would have the same net effect. Labour steps and equipment details however, make a lot of sense to be in separate classes as they are separate entities and not just properties of work orders.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Design", "Interface", "Data Structure"], "format": "Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Forum", "instructed_query": "In a long discussion on a forum, should interface only be used for behavior and not to show logical data grouped together?

Several techniques are investigated for combining both spatial and spectral information. Spatial information is extracted at the object (set of pixels) level rather than at the conventional pixel level. Mathematical morphology is first used to derive the morphological profile of the image, which includes characteristics about the size, orientation, and contrast of the spatial structures present in the image. Then, the morphological neighborhood is defined and used to derive additional features for classification. Classification is performed with support vector machines (SVMs) using the available spectral information and the extracted spatial information. Spatial postprocessing is next investigated to build more homogeneous and spatially consistent thematic maps. To that end, three presegmentation techniques are applied to define regions that are used to regularize the preliminary pixel-wise thematic map. Finally, a multiple-classifier (MC) system is defined to produce relevant markers that are exploited to segment the hyperspectral image with the minimum spanning forest algorithm. Experimental results conducted on three real hyperspectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions and corresponding to various contexts are presented.

Statistical methods in machine translation (e.g. (Brown et al., 1990)) typically rely on large quantities of bilingual text aligned at the document or sentence level, and a number of approaches in the burgeoning field of crosslanguage information retrieval exploit parallel corpora either in place of or in addition to mappings between languages based on information from bilingual dictionaries (Davis and Dunning, 1995; Landauer and Littman, 1990; Hull and Oard, 1997; Oard, 1997).

Although the majority of Web content is in English, it also shows great promise as a source of multilingual content. Using figures from the Babel survey of multilinguality on the Web (h tZp : / /www. i s o c . o r g / ) , it is possible to estimate that as of June, 1997, there were on the order of 63000 primarily non-English Web servers, ranging over 14 languages. Moreover, a followup investigation of the non-English servers suggests that nearly a third contain some useful cross-language data, such as parallel English on the page or links to parallel English pages the follow-up also found pages in five languages not identified by the Babel study (Catalan, Chinese, Hungarian, Icelandic, and Arabic; Michael Littman, personal communication). Given the continued explosive increase in the size of the Web, the trend toward business organizations that cross national boundaries, and high levels of competition for consumers in a global marketplace, it seems impossible not to view multilingual content on the Web as an expanding resource. Moreover, it is a dynamic resource, changing in content as the world changes.

And Gey et al., also at TREC-7, observed that in doing cross-language retrieval using commercial machine translation systems, gaps in the lexicon (their example was acupuncture/Akupunktur) could make the difference between precision of 0.08 and precision of 0.83 on individual queries. ttesnik (1998) presented an algorithm called", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Machine Translation", "Natural Language Processing"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Conference Proceedings", "instructed_query": "Explore the improved statistical machine translation using monolingually-derived paraphrases in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

When studies attempt to group queries together by task or session, a timeout is typically used to identify the boundary. However, users query search engines in order to accomplish tasks at a variety of granularities, issuing multiple queries as they attempt to accomplish tasks. In this work we study real sessions manually labeled into hierarchical tasks, and show that timeouts, whatever their length, are of limited utility in identifying task boundaries, achieving a maximum precision of only 70%. We report on properties of this search task hierarchy, as seen in a random sample of user interactions from a major web search engine's log, annotated by human editors, learning that 17% of tasks are interleaved, and 20% are hierarchically organized. No previous work has analyzed or addressed automatic identification of interleaved and hierarchically organized search tasks. We propose and evaluate a method for the automated segmentation of users' query streams into hierarchical units. Our classifiers can improve on timeout segmentation, as well as other previously published approaches, bringing the accuracy up to 92% for identifying fine-grained task boundaries, and 89-97% for identifying pairs of queries from the same task when tasks are interleaved hierarchically. This is the first work to identify, measure and automatically segment sequences of user queries into their hierarchical structure.

Since developing this standard, the Joint Video Team of the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has also standardized an extension of that technology that is referred to as multiview video coding (MVC). MVC provides a compact representation for multiple views of a video scene, such as multiple synchronized video cameras. Stereo-paired video for 3-D viewing is an important special case of MVC. The standard enables inter-view prediction to improve compression capability, as well as supporting ordinary temporal and spatial prediction. It also supports backward compatibility with existing legacy systems by structuring the MVC bitstream to include a compatible “base view.” Each other view is encoded at the same picture resolution as the base view. In recognition of its high-quality encoding capability and support for backward compatibility, the stereo high profile of the MVC extension was selected by the Blu-Ray Disc Association as the coding format for 3-D video with high-definition resolution. This paper provides an overview of the algorithmic design used for extending H.264/MPEG-4 AVC towards MVC. The basic approach of MVC for enabling inter-view prediction and view scalability in the context of H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is reviewed. Related supplemental enhancement information (SEI) metadata is also described. Various “frame compatible” approaches for support of stereo-view video as an alternative to MVC are also discussed.

In Joel Spolsky's famous (or infamous) article Thins You Should Never Do, Part I, he makes the case that doing a rewrite is always a wrong move because:   1. It automatically puts you behind (your competitors/schedule/etc.)   2. The code probably isn't as bad as the programmers believe (anything someone else wrote is always a mess, although some are bigger messes than others - and even then)   3. It's probably easier/quicker/cheaper to fix what's truly wrong with it than to rewrite from scratch.   4. In rewriting from scratch, you are probably going to re-introduce bugs that were fixed in previous versions the original code. Instead, he recommends fixing what's wrong with the code. I assume this is a good summary of his post, and I'll postulate that it is generally true. I'm trying to collect a set of rules/guideline for my team, and one of them (based on Joel's article) is               We don’t re-write ... ever!      - But we can refactor large portions of the code.       (this exception takes care of ugly/problematic code issues)      One question that has cropped up is \"What about when technology changes and you can no longer get support for older versions?\". This is what I think of as the Sisyphean Upgrade path. E.g., I recall when Oracle moved from SQL*Forms 2.x/3.x through to Forms 6i and beyond, Forms that were originality developed in the old .inp format were no longer supported with the current version of Oracle and Oracle Forms. So you had a choice of sticking with an unsupported database with unsupported tools or rewriting the Forms from scratch (or converted with 3rd party tools and then gone over with a fine toothed comb). Which I will call porting, particularly when you are doing a faithful line by line/function by function translation into the new tech and not adding any functionality. The rule then became:               We don’t re-write ... ever!     - But we can refactor large portions of the code.     - And we can port the code to a new platform when we *truly* have no other        choice.      (and by truly I mean, you can't even buy your way out of the problem for 2x the cost of porting it) Are there any other exceptions that I've missed?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Engineering", "Legacy Systems"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Tech Blog", "instructed_query": "How can I sell a legacy program rewrite to the business?

The ability to gather relevant information in real time is key to leveraging the value of the IoT as such information will be transformed into intelligence, which will facilitate the creation of an intelligent environment. Ultimately, the quality of the information gathered depends on how smart the devices are. In addition, these communicating devices will operate with different networking standards, may experience intermittent connectivity with each other, and many of them will be resource constrained. These characteristics open up several networking challenges that traditional routing protocols cannot solve. Consequently, devices will require intelligent routing protocols in order to achieve intelligent D2D communication.

Aiming to develop a systematic understanding of the interplay between social structure and mobile communications, in this paper we exploit social ties in human social networks to enhance cooperative device-to-device communications. Specifically, as hand-held devices are carried by human beings, we leverage two key social phenomena, namely social trust and social reciprocity, to promote efficient cooperation among devices. With this insight, we develop a coalitional game theoretic framework to devise social-tie based cooperation strategies for device-to-device communications. We also develop a network assisted relay selection mechanism to implement the coalitional game solution, and show that the mechanism is immune to group deviations, individually rational, and truthful. We evaluate the performance of the mechanism by using real social data traces.

Applications include the continuous authentication of radio and TV Internet broadcasts, and authenticated data distribution by satellite. The main challenges are fourfold. First, authenticity must be guaranteed even when only the sender of the data is trusted. Second, the scheme needs to scale to potentially millions of receivers. Third, streamed media distribution can have high packet loss. Finally, the system needs to be efficient to support fast packet rates. We propose two efficient schemes, TESLA and EMSS, for secure lossy multicast streams. TESLA, short for Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication, offers sender authentication, strong loss robustness, high scalability, and minimal overhead, at the cost of loose initial time synchronization and slightly delayed authentication. EMSS, short for Efficient Multi-chained Stream Signature, provides nonrepudiation of origin, high loss resistance, and low overhead, at the cost of slightly delayed verification.

In D2D communications, the user equipments (UEs) are allowed to directly communicate between each other by reusing the cellular resources rather than using uplink and downlink resources in the cellular mode when communicating via the base station. However, enabling D2D communications in a cellular network poses two major challenges. First, the interference caused to the cellular users by D2D devices could critically affect the performances of the cellular devices. Second, the minimum quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of D2D communications need to be guaranteed. In this article, we introduce a novel resource allocation scheme (i.e. joint resource block scheduling and power control) for D2D communications in LTE-Advanced networks to maximize the spectrum utilization while addressing the above challenges. First, an overview of LTE-Advanced networks, and architecture and signaling support for provisioning of D2D communications in these networks are described. Furthermore, research issues and the current state-of-the-art of D2D communications are discussed. Then, a resource allocation scheme based on a column generation method is proposed for D2D communications. The objective is to maximize the spectrum utilization by finding the minimum transmission length in terms of time slots for D2D links while protecting the cellular users from harmful interference and guaranteeing the QoS of D2D links.

Based on the proposed antenna, a 4 × 4 array is also designed. Both the proposed antenna and array are fabricated with standard printed circuit board (PCB) process, which possess the advantage of easy integration with planar circuits. The measured bandwidth (|S11| ≤ -10 dB) of the antenna element is larger than 15%, and that of the antenna array is about 8.7%. The measured peak gains are 6.5 dBi for the element and 17.8 dBi for the array, and the corresponding simulated radiation efficiencies are 83.9% and 74.9%, respectively.

We present a framework that capitalizes on temporal structure in unlabeled video to learn to anticipate human actions and objects.

Visual representations are a promising prediction target because they encode images at a higher semantic level than pixels yet are automatic to compute.

In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Face Recognition"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss face recognition using the stepwise nonparametric margin maximum criterion in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

In addition, we derive a simple method of replacing costly computation of nonlinear (on-line) Bayesian similarity measures by inexpensive linear (off-line) subspace projections and simple Euclidean norms, thus resulting in a significant computational speed-up for implementation with very large databases.

Traditionally, only binary relations have been extracted from large numbers of published papers. Recently, more complex relations (biomolecular events) have also been extracted. Such events may include several entities or other relations. To evaluate the performance of the text mining systems, several shared task challenges have been arranged for the BioNLP community. With a common and consistent task setting, the BioNLP'09 shared task evaluated complex biomolecular events such as binding and regulation.Finding these events automatically is important in order to improve biomedical event extraction systems. In the present paper, we propose an automatic event extraction system, which contains a model for complex events, by solving a classification problem with rich features. The main contributions of the present paper are: (1) the proposal of an effective bio-event detection method using machine learning, (2) provision of a high-performance event extraction system, and (3) the execution of a quantitative error analysis.

The experiments conducted on various inputs indicate that this method achieves intrinsic 2D chromaticity images which are free of shadows.

The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers[6]. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest.

Abstract We investigate the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in computer vision. SVM is a learning technique developed by V. Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs.) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classi ers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Machine Learning", "Ground Penetrating Radar"], "format": "Conference Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Proceedings of CVPR", "instructed_query": "Discuss Buried Object Detection from B-Scan Ground Penetrating Radar Data Using Faster-RCNN in a long conference paper written in English for researchers, suitable for the Proceedings of CVPR.", "reversed_query": "Discuss Buried Object Detection from B-Scan Ground Penetrating Radar Data Using Faster-RCNN but do not present it in a long conference paper written in English for researchers, nor suitable for the Proceedings of CVPR."}

Although the advent of these techniques has gradually enabled clarification of the functional contributions of the prefrontal cortex in deception with respect to executive function, the specific roles of subregions within the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions responsible for emotional regulation or social interactions during deception are still unclear. Assuming that the processes of falsifying truthful responses and deceiving others are differentially associated with the activities of these regions, we conducted a positron emission tomography experiment with 2 (truth, lie) 2 (honesty, dishonesty) factorial design. The main effect of falsifying the truthful responses revealed increased brain activity of the left dorsolateral and right anterior prefrontal cortices, supporting the interpretation of previous studies that executive functions are related to making untruthful responses. The main effect of deceiving the interrogator showed activations of the ventromedial prefrontal (medial orbitofrontal) cortex and amygdala, adding new evidence that the brain regions assumed to be responsible for emotional processing or social interaction are active during deceptive behavior similar to that in real-life situations. Further analysis revealed that activity of the right anterior prefrontal cortex showed both effects of deception, indicating that this region has a pivotal role in telling lies. Our results provide clear evidence of functionally dissociable roles of the prefrontal subregions and amygdala for human deception.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Psychology", "Neuroscience", "Deception"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore the topic of detecting deception: the scope and limits in an academic paper written in English for researchers.", "reversed_query": "Explore the topic of detecting deception: the scope and limits, but do not present it as an academic paper in English for researchers."}

Taken separately, specific studies vary in task dimensions and in type(s) of emotion studied and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity. By examining findings across studies, we sought to determine if common or segregated patterns of activations exist across various emotional tasks. We reviewed 55 PET and fMRI activation studies (yielding 761 individual peaks) which investigated emotion in healthy subjects. Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings. We divided the brain into 20 nonoverlapping regions, and characterized each region by its responsiveness across individual emotions (positive, negative, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust), to different induction methods (visual, auditory, recall/imagery), and in emotional tasks with and without cognitive demand. Our review yielded the following summary observations: (1) The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing; (2) fear specifically engaged the amygdala; (3) sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate; (4) emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala; (5) induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula; (6) emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula.

Furthermore, the track-stair interactive forces are complicated, which may take the forms of grouser-tread hooking force, track--stair edge frictional force, grouser-riser clutching force, and even their compositions. In this paper, the track--stair interactions are analyzed systematically, and tipover stability criteria are derived for a tracked mobile robot climbing stairs.

Tracks are efficient on uneven terrains or on soft surfaces (snow, mud, etc.), while wheels are optimal on flat surfaces. Our objective is to work on a new concept capable of combining different locomotion mechanisms to increase the locomotion capabilities of the robotic platform. The design we came up with, called AZIMUT, is symmetrical and is made of four independent leg-track-wheel articulations. It can move with its articulations up, down or straight, allowing the robot to deal with three-dimensional environments. AZIMUT is also capable of moving sideways without changing its orientation, making it omnidirectional. By putting sensors on these articulations, the robot can also actively perceive its environment by changing the orientation of its articulations. Designing a robot with such capabilities requires addressing difficult design compromises, with measurable impacts seen only after integrating all of the components together.

We convert the rough sketch into a simplified version which is then amendable for vectorization. This is all done in a fully automatic way without user intervention. Our model consists of a fully convolutional neural network which, unlike most existing convolutional neural networks, is able to process images of any dimensions and aspect ratio as input, and outputs a simplified sketch which has the same dimensions as the input image. In order to teach our model to simplify, we present a new dataset of pairs of rough and simplified sketch drawings. By leveraging convolution operators in combination with efficient use of our proposed dataset, we are able to train our sketch simplification model. Our approach naturally overcomes the limitations of existing methods, e.g., vector images as input and long computation time; and we show that meaningful simplifications can be obtained for many different test cases. Finally, we validate our results with a user study in which we greatly outperform similar approaches and establish the state of the art in sketch simplification of raster images.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Deep Learning", "Image Processing"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Research Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss Chinese/English mixed character segmentation as semantic segmentation in an academic paper.

Mobility is a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society strives for safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs. Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs among societies, depending on their culture and their degree of industrialization. A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors, such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence. These steps are considered important for the interim period, until reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal and market trends.

Now, I may be not finding an obvious better answer, but if my answer is the \"correct\", that means that sometimes writting unit tests can break encapsulation, and divide the same responsibility into different classes. A simple example would be testing a setter method when a getter is not actually needed for anything in the real code. Please when aswering don't provide simple answers to specific cases I may have written. Rather, try to explain more of the generic case and theoretical approach. And this is neither language specific. Thanks in advance. **EDIT:** The answer given by Matthew Flynn was really insightful, but didn't quite answer the question. Altough he made the fair point that you either don't test private methods or extract them because they really are other concern and responsibility (or at least that was what I could understand from his answer), I think there are situations where unit testing private methods is useful. My primary example is when you have a class that has one responsibility but the output (or input) that it gives (takes) is just to complex. For example, a hashing function. There's no good way to break a hashing function apart and mantain cohesion and encapsulation. However, testing a hashing function can be really tough, since you would need to calculate by hand (you can't use code calculation to test code calculation!) the hashing, and test multiple cases where the hash changes. In that way (and this may be a question worth of its own topic) I think private method testing is the best way to handle it. Now, I'm not sure if I should ask another question, or ask it here, but are there any better way to test such complex output (input)? OBS: Please, if you think I should ask another question on that topic, leave a comment. :) **EDIT2:** I accepted a answer as my correct because it made me think and decide my course of action, altough it didn't answered my queston completely. But for those who face the same problem as I do (one cohesive class that will change together, but is still too hard to test by itsfelf), I'll tell what I did and why. I decided that the output of that class is simply too hard to a computer to test correctly, so I didn't test it. I could have used a framework to test it's private methods (which would be the best idea, I think), but I didn't want to get to that point. If you are wondering what it is that is cohesive and respects SRP, and still is too hard to a computer to test, I'll give some examples: heightmap generation, hashing functions, procedural music generation (you can test some units, but the highest level unit is simply too subjective).", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Software Development", "Testing", "TDD"], "format": "Forum Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "StackOverflow", "instructed_query": "As a developer new to TDD, should I avoid private methods now?

{"dataset": "beir/cqadupstack/programmers", "query_id": "193929", "query": "\"Too object-oriented\"", "document": "I've been recently assigned for a new high-performance C++ project (finance) together with 3 other guys who, like, me, refer to themselves as \"primarily C/C++ programmers\", meaning, all of us have also done Java & other stuff, we all have comparable experience (8 to 10 years) and have successfully collaborated for the making of other projects (not C/C++). I soon found out we have such different mindsets when it comes to our \"mother programming tongue\" that it risks not only the good delivery of the project but also the general well-being of the team/office. Specifically: They come from an electrical engineering/automation/polytechnic type of background, so their reasoning is intimately related to how hardware works, how bytes move around, processor workings, instruction caching, generally everything at the lower layers. They did embedded programming, ARM programming (I barely know what those are). I soon found out their practical experience is with mostly C, not C++. They think procedurally, not OOP. I, on the other hand, have trained myself to think in a more abstract way, to apply principles such as encapsulation, low coupling/high cohesion for creating reusable, modular software. My speciality is the C++ programming language, with an accent on language constructs that help you get both fast and reusable, generic code. I think design patterns, idioms, concepts. Throughout 9 years of developing software I consistently witnessed how poor maintainability of software systems is by far the #1 burden of teams. I generously document my code, write careful interfaces. I embrace template meta-programming as a way to obtain fast and reusable products. I embrace the new C++11 standard features. Where I see reusability and loose coupling, they see \"complication\". They want to \"see it all there\". They want to see `char*`, not some buffer class in interface methods. At one point one even said \"I don't care how simple your interfaces are if your implementation looks complicated\". The trouble is, we really are trying to transition from a monolithic style of systems to a reusable one - we are writing a library. Yet they don't wish to see their C-style structs being polluted with templated methods, typedefs and c-tors, even if neither makes their structs non-POD. They also don't wish to see static_assert(std::is_pod<...>). They love memcpy and pointers and generally stay away from references. They tend to think typedefs are somehow evil. I really tried to make them see an abstraction for what it is. It is code together with data it operates on. By necessity, a library needs to define some interfaces for the user to be able to plug it into a larger product. They tend to see these interfaces as ways in which my code _requires their code behave/look as I wish and doesn't allow them to do things their way_ , but without actually telling me a specific functionality they can't obtain. Make no mistake, I'm no ignorant when it comes to performance. I know about cache lines, branch prediction, the overhead of method virtualization, heap allocation, hash lookups. I'm good with complexity of algorithms (though that doesn't matter so much here), data structures, inlining and some other compiler optimizations such as RVO. I believe with a modern compiler a reusable, layered OOP C++ product can get within 10% of the performance of a C-only monolithic product, when carefully written and optimized. I honestly believed we would complement each other in our thinking. What are your thoughts?

This is what I have:               class Article {     public:         const std::string author;         std::string title;         std::string text;         const uint32_t id;         system_clock::time_point timestamp;              Article(const std::string auth&,                 const std::string tit&,                 const std::string txt&,                 const system_clock::time_point&);          private:         Article(const Article&);         void operator=(const Article&);         static uint32_t id_pool;     };      My motivation is this: `author` should never change -> `const` `title` could change if edited -> `non-const` `text` could change if edited -> `non-const` `id` should never change -> `const` `timestamp` could change but probably shouldn't, I'm not sure what to do with it yet. `id_pool` is just where I get IDs from. One specification is that IDs should never be reused so I just increment `id_pool` in the Article constructor. Coming from Java with all the getters and setters that I really don't like, and then some Python with it's \"Everything public\" and properties, that I do like, I'm getting a bit confused here. I mean, I could make the members private and have getters and setters (I can't think of any natural \"verb-methods\" that an Article can \"do\"), but it feels like I would gain very little. I would be thankful for some pointers on good design in this case.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Student", "keyword": ["Programming", "C++", "Software Design"], "format": "Discussion Forum", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Online Forum", "instructed_query": "Is it bad practice to use public fields?

I don't get it. Imagine we're creating a multiplayer dungeon crawl (a roguelike) using FP where we emphasize pure functions and immutable data structures. We generate a dungeon composed of rooms, corridors, heroes, monsters and loot. Our world is effectively an object graph of structures and their relationships. As things change our representation of the world is amended to reflect those changes. Our hero kills a rat, picks up a shortsword, etc. To me the world (current reality) carries this idea of state and I'm missing how FP overcomes this. As our hero takes action, functions amend the state of the world. It appears to be every decision (AI or human) needs to be based on the state of the world as it is in the present. Where would we allow for concurrency? We can't have multiple processes concurrently ammending the state of the world lest one process base its outcomes on some expired state. It feels to me that all control should occur within a single control loop so that we're always processing the present state represented by our current object graph of the world. Clearly there are situations perfectly suited for concurrency (i.e. When processing isolated tasks whose states are independent of one another).

My impression is that projects using a DI framework like Spring or Guice tend to lose their object orientation and degenerate to a purely procedural design:   1. DI not only centralizes the question of which implementation of an object to use but also manages the life-cycle of these objects. Many OO **design patterns** , however, rely on the ability of business logic to wire objects. I wouldn't know, for example, how to implement a Strategy Pattern in Spring because the decision which of the concrete strategies to use, is statically determined by the configuration of the application instead of a piece of code. Same goes for decorator, composite, observer, ...   2. The reason above leads to a design where functionality and data are separated. Because you don't want to let the DI container decide when data is created, you split any code off the data in order to have only this part managed by the DI container. This is contrary to the idea of OO where **code and data should reside together** in one unit. This breaks the **encapsulation of data** because all fields of the data \"beans\" are exposed by public getters and setters.   3. You can't use **polymorphism** anymore because code is not linked to its data anymore and the \"virtual functions\" can't work. This leads to those instanceof cascades that we all know we shouldn't use. Also, we lose all those designs that rely on polymorphism.   4. The DI container will inject managed beans only in objects which are also managed by it. So you can't **mix managed beans and normal objects** because there can't be any \"non-managed gaps\" in the reference chain of managed beans. So once you started with DI, you need to put all other code under the control of the DI container and you can't use normal objects anymore. I suppose that this is the reason why the separation of code and data is done so rigorously in DI projects. I see that there are reasons why to use DI but is it really worth giving up so much? Don't people care about OO? Apart from this **article** , I can't find any discussions on this topic. Or is it just me who doesn't understand how to do this properly? Any ideas how the four points above can be tackled with? **Appendix 1: Explanation of strategy pattern** I refer to the example here. Let's assume there's a DI version of it where all implementations of `Strategy` and the `Context` are injected to `StrategyExample`. Then `StrategyExample` doesn't decide anymore which `Strategy` to inject into `Context` but the configuration would have already decided which implementation to inject into `Context`. So yes, DI heavily applies the Strategy Pattern. But it always does so statically.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Engineering", "Design Patterns"], "format": "Forum Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "StackOverflow", "instructed_query": "Does 'Inversion of Control' promote 'Anemic Domain Model'?

Is there a good rule of thumb?", "document": "I want to introduce the concept of unit tests (and testing in general) to my co-workers; right now there are no tests at all and things are tested by actually performing the tasks via the UI to see the desired result. As you might imagine, the code is very tightly coupled to the exact implementation - even resulting in code that should be in a class and reused across the system being copied and pasted across methods. Due to changed requirements, I have been asked to modify a module I previously wrote and that is fairly loosely coupled (not as much as I would like, but as best I can get without having to introduce a lot of other concepts). I've decided to include a suite of unit tests with my revised code to \"prove\" that it works as expected and demonstrate how testing works; I'm not following true TDD as some of the code is already written but I'm hoping to follow some TDD concepts for the new code I'll have to create. Now, inevitably I'm sure I'll be asked why it's taking me more than a day or two to write the code, since parts of what I'll be interacting with already exist in the system (albeit without any tests and very tightly coupled), and when I check the code in I'll be asked just what this \"Tests\" project is. I can explain the basics of testing, but I can't explain the actual benefits in a way the others would understand (because they think testing requires you to run the app yourself, since often the actual UI matters in determining if the feature \"works\" or not). They don't understand the idea of loose coupling (clearly evident by the fact nothing is loosely coupled; there aren't even any interfaces outside of the code I've written), so trying to use that as a benefit would probably earn me a \"Huh?\" kind of look, and again I can't be as loose as I would like to without having to rework several existing modules and probably introduce some kind of IoC container, which would be viewed as wasting time and not \"programming\". Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can point to this code and say \"We should start creating unit tests\" without coming off as either condescending (e.g. \"Writing tests forces you to write good code.\" which would probably be taken to mean code except mine is _bad_ ) or without making it seem like a waste of time that doesn't add any real value?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Software Development", "Testing", "Open Source"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Personal Blog", "instructed_query": "How do you judge the value of using TDD or plain unit testing in an Open Source project?

The types of applications I am developing always have a custom aspect to them. So there will always be some code written which is client specific for every project. The method we are using now is as follows: Several 'CORE' projects exist in isolation from one another, each core project is a class library which is capable of running on its own, or with dependencies on other core modules. All of these core modules are documented (Sandcastle) and NuGet packages created for them, which are served up via a private NuGet feed. When a customer purchases the software we create a customer specific project which implements the bespoke code that they require, and pulls in the NuGet packages from the core libs as needed. The build of this project is what is provided to the customer, and each customer project has it's own Git repository. This has worked fine for a year or so, but I feel that as we add features to the core libraries the number of nuget packages is growing quite quickly.

These certificates will be used for authentication to the banks website either instead of or as an add-on to username/password login. The platforms/OS etc are still not fixed. Assume that enrollment has been done - i.e. bank knows the certificate going to be used by each user. ## Design I was wondering what's the best way to do authentication?   1. I saw that Apache has a way to enable 2 way ssl - in this case, i think navigating to the website would automatically ask for a cert from the user. But I am not sure if this is enough because it seems that all it verifies is whether a certificate is signed by a trusted CA & also may be whether it falls in a white list of subject lines of the certificates etc. But this is not enough for a bank case because you need to be able to associate a bankuserid with a certificate.   2. IIS seems to have a way by which I can have a certificate stored for each user in Active Directory. This is what I understood from reading few MSDN articles. You turn on 2 way SSL in IIS & then when the user tries to navigate to the website, IIS will send a request to the browser with a list of approved CAs and browser will let the user pick an appropriate certificate from his certstore and sends it to backend. I am assuming that IIS will do 2 things     * Ensure that the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by under the cover negotiations)     * Based on the AD User-Cert Mapping, IIS will report the username to the application.   3. Do the authentication explicity by calling crypto functions rather depending on depending on the webserver to do it.     * Show a user screen where he uploads a certificate and the application ensures the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by asking the front-end to sign some string using the cert).     * The application has a database some of data is stored which allows each user to be mapped to his userid. This may be      * the whole cert corresponding to each userid     * the CA and cert serial number corresponding to each user id. I was wondering which is the commonly used method? What are the best practices? If I should go with #3, what are the best ways to do this?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Web Security", "PKI", "Authentication"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Personal Blog", "instructed_query": "Explore Web Authentication using PKI Certs in this medium-length blog post written in English for developers.", "reversed_query": "Explore Web Authentication using PKI Certs, but do not present it as a medium-length blog post in English for developers."}

Both teams are located in India. I am on the west coast of the U.S. I'm finding leading remote teams challenging: First, their command of the English language is weak. Second, I'm having difficultly understanding them through their accents. Third is timing, we are 12 hours apart. We use Skype to communicate. I have a month to get the project done. We've burned through a week just setting up the environments. At this point I'm considering working their hours, 11p PDT to 7a PDT, to get them up to speed, so that I can get the project off the ground. A 12 hour lag time is too much. I'm looking for steps I can take to be successful at leading an offshore team. **Update** The offshore team's primary task is coding, of course, most coding tasks do involve some design work. The offshore team's are composed of one lead, 2 mid level (4 to 5 years) developers and a junior (~2 years) developer. The project is classic waterfall. We've handed the offshore team a business and a technical design document. We are trying to manage the offshore in an agile way. We have daily conference calls with them and I'm requiring the teams to send me a daily scrum in the form of an email answering the following questions:   1. What did I do today?   2. What am I going to do tomorrow?   3. What do I need from Chuck so I can do my job tomorrow? There is some ambiguity in the tasks. The intent was to give them enough direction for them to develop the task with out writing the code for them. I don't have a travel budget. I am using Fogbugz to track the tasks. Each task has been entered into Fogbugz and given a priority. Each team member has access to FogBugz and can choose what task they wish to complete. _Related question_ : What can we do to improve the way outsourcing/offshoring works? **Update 2** I've decided that I can not talk to the team once a day. I must work with them. Starting tonight I've started working the same hours they are. This makes me available to them when they have questions. It also allows me to gain their trust and respect. **Update 3** The project was completed and delivered on time. The key factor was me working the same time as the offshore team. If that had not occurred I'm confident we would have failed. I managed two offshore teams. One of the teams under preformed and I fired them taking on the work myself. Things that lead to success was: Communication, understand their culture and how they communicate. Build rapport with them. A couple of the workers I keep in touch a year after the project completed. Meetings, we met at the beginning of their day so any questions or blocked tasks could be addressed. At the end of the day a daily summary was send out by the worker describing their day and if they encountered any issues. Ideally we could resolve their issues by the start of their next day. Questions, ask questions. Most cases information is not volunteered. Be visible. Being online, available and reachable help fostered the team's commitment to the project. I was not just the daily email. Make it easy. Internally we had a complex QA system in which bugs where tracked. It was complex and hard to use. I paid the $$ for a fogbugz account for each of the team members. Most of the team had used FogBugz and understood the workflow. Daily I would update the fogbugz with new bugs and update the QA system from Fogbugz. **Stackoverflow question** Leading an offshore team", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Manager", "keyword": ["Project Management", "Remote Work"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Personal Blog", "instructed_query": "Here are some tips for managing an offshore development team.

It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of γ-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure. Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation. In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Image Processing"], "format": "Academic Article", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore how to use contours to detect and localize junctions in natural images.

The wavelet transform of singularities with fast oscillations have a particular behavior that is studied separately. The local frequency of such oscillations are measured from the wavelet transform modulus maxima. It has been shown numerically that oneand two-dimensional signals can be reconstructed, with a good approximation, from the local maxima of their wavelet transform modulus.

This study compares wet electrodes to dry and through hair, noncontact electrodes within a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI paradigm. The construction of a dry contact electrode, featuring fingered contact posts and active buffering circuitry is presented. Additionally, the development of a new, noncontact, capacitive electrode that utilizes a custom integrated, high-impedance analog front-end is introduced. Offline tests on 10 subjects characterize the signal quality from the different electrodes and demonstrate that acquisition of small amplitude, SSVEP signals is possible, even through hair using the new integrated noncontact sensor. Online BCI experiments demonstrate that the information transfer rate (ITR) with the dry electrodes is comparable to that of wet electrodes, completely without the need for gel or other conductive media. In addition, data from the noncontact electrode, operating on the top of hair, show a maximum ITR in excess of 19 bits/min at 100% accuracy (versus 29.2 bits/min for wet electrodes and 34.4 bits/min for dry electrodes), a level that has never been demonstrated before.

Although several approaches have been proposed to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions or speech, relatively limited work has been done to fuse these two, and other, modalities to improve the accuracy and robustness of the emotion recognition system. This paper analyzes the strengths and the limitations of systems based only on facial expressions or acoustic information. It also discusses two approaches used to fuse these two modalities: decision level and feature level integration. Using a database recorded from an actress, four emotions were classified: sadness, anger, happiness, and neutral state. By the use of markers on her face, detailed facial motions were captured with motion capture, in conjunction with simultaneous speech recordings. The results reveal that the system based on facial expression gave better performance than the system based on just acoustic information for the emotions considered. Results also show the complementarily of the two modalities and that when these two modalities are fused, the performance and the robustness of the emotion recognition system improve measurably.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Neuroscience", "Emotion Recognition", "Human-Computer Interaction"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss the Self-Adhesive and Capacitive Carbon Nanotube-Based Electrode to Record Electroencephalograph Signals From the Hairy Scalp in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

ETL (Extraction-Transformation-Loading) processes are responsible for the extraction of data from heterogeneous operational data sources, their transformation (conversion, cleaning, normalization, etc.) and their loading into DWs. ETL processes are a key component of DWs because incorrect or misleading data will produce wrong business decisions, and therefore, a correct design of these processes at early stages of a DW project is absolutely necessary to improve data quality. However, not much research has dealt with the modeling of ETL processes. In this paper, we present our approach, based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which allows us to accomplish the conceptual modeling of these ETL processes together with the conceptual schema of the target DW in an integrated manner. We provide the necessary mechanisms for an easy and quick specification of the common operations defined in these ETL processes such as, the integration of different data sources, the transformation between source and target attributes, the generation of surrogate keys and so on. Moreover, our approach allows the designer a comprehensive tracking and documentation of entire ETL processes, which enormously facilitates the maintenance of these processes. Another advantage of our proposal is the use of the UML (standardization, ease-of-use and functionality) and the seamless integration of the design of the ETL processes with the DW conceptual schema. Finally, we show how to use our integrated approach by using a well-known modeling tool such as Rational Rose.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Data Professional", "keyword": ["Data Warehousing", "ETL", "Business Intelligence"], "format": "Research Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Academic Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore the Data Warehouse Life-Cycle and Design in a research paper written in English for data professionals.", "reversed_query": "Explore the Data Warehouse Life-Cycle and Design, but do not present it in a research paper written in English for data professionals."}

Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections, measure economic indicators, and so on. Recently, social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large scale visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics, such as those in image tweets, so that prediction of sentiment from visual content is complementary to textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the needs in leveraging large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of image sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We first design a suitable CNN architecture for image sentiment analysis. We obtain half a million training samples by using a baseline sentiment algorithm to label Flickr images. To make use of such noisy machine labeled data, we employ a progressive strategy to fine-tune the deep network. Furthermore, we improve the performance on Twitter images by inducing domain transfer with a small number of manually labeled Twitter images. We have conducted extensive experiments on manually labeled Twitter images. The results show that the proposed CNN can achieve better performance in image sentiment analysis than competing algorithms.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Sentiment Analysis", "Social Media", "Image Processing"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore EmoBGM: Estimating sound's emotion for creating slideshows with suitable BGM.

With technological advance on microelectronic and vision system, high performance automatic techniques on biometric recognition are now becoming economically feasible. Among all the biometric identification methods, face recognition has attracted much attention in recent years because it has potential to be most nonintrusive and user-friendly. The PDBNN face recognition system consists of three modules: First, a face detector finds the location of a human face in an image. Then an eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes in order to generate meaningful feature vectors. The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes, and nose, but excluding mouth (eye-glasses will be allowed). Lastly, the third module is a face recognizer. The PDBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules. It adopts a hierarchical network structures with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. The paper demonstrates a successful application of PDBNN to face recognition applications on two public (FERET and ORL) and one in-house (SCR) databases. Regarding the performance, experimental results on three different databases such as recognition accuracies as well as false rejection and false acceptance rates are elaborated. As to the processing speed, the whole recognition process (including PDBNN processing for eye localization, feature extraction, and classification) consumes approximately one second on Sparc10, without using hardware accelerator or co-processor.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Face Recognition", "Biometrics"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore the topic of Face Detection Using Quantized Skin Color Regions Merging and Wavelet Packet Analysis in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Face Recognition", "Image Processing"], "format": "Research Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Academic Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore the topic of Face Detection Using Quantized Skin Color Regions Merging and Wavelet Packet Analysis in a long research paper written in English for researchers, published in an academic journal.", "reversed_query": "Explore the topic of Face Detection Using Quantized Skin Color Regions Merging and Wavelet Packet Analysis, but do not present it as a long research paper in English for researchers or published in an academic journal."}

The online phase is unconditionally secure and has total computational (and communication) complexity linear in n, the number of players, where earlier work was quadratic in n. Moreover, the work done by each player is only a small constant factor larger than what one would need to compute the circuit in the clear. We show this is optimal for computation in large fields.

Although many ciphersuites are now well-understood in isolation, their composition remains problematic, and yet it is critical to obtain practical security guarantees for TLS. We experimentally confirm that all mainstream implementations of TLS share key materials between different algorithms, some of them of dubious strength. We outline attacks in their handling of resumption and renegotiation, stressing the need to model multiple related instances of the handshake. We study the provable security of the TLS handshake, as it is implemented and deployed. To capture the details of the standard and its main extensions, we rely on miTLS, a verified reference implementation of the protocol. miTLS inter-operates with mainstream browsers and servers for many protocol versions, configurations, and ciphersuites; and it provides application-level, provable security for some. We propose new agile security definitions and assumptions for the signatures, key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM), and key derivation algorithms used by the TLS handshake. By necessity, our definitions are stronger than those expected with simple modern protocols. To validate our model of key encapsulation, we prove that both RSA and Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites satisfy our definition for the KEM. In particular, we formalize the use of PKCS#1v1.5 encryption in TLS, including recommended countermeasures against Bleichenbacher attacks, and build a 3,000-line EasyCrypt proof of the security of the resulting master secret KEM against replayable chosen-ciphertext attacks under the assumption that ciphertexts are hard to re-randomize. Based on our new agile definitions, we construct a modular proof of security for the miTLS reference implementation of the handshake, including ciphersuite negotiation, key exchange, renegotiation, and resumption, treated as a detailed 3,600-line executable model. We present our main definitions, constructions, and proofs for an abstract model of the protocol, featuring series of related runs of the handshake with different ciphersuites. We also describe its refinement to account for the whole reference implementation, based on automated verification tools.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Cryptography", "Blockchain", "Security"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Research Journal", "instructed_query": "Discuss Raziel: Private and Verifiable Smart Contracts on Blockchains in detail.

Because the test to see if the loop should end is in the middle of a logical set of steps, the while loop itself currently doesn't check anything meaningful; the check is instead performed at the \"proper\" place within the conceptual algorithm. I was told that this is bad code, because it is more bug-prone due to the ending condition not being checked by the loop structure. It's more difficult to figure out how you'd exit the loop, and could invite bugs as the breaking condition might be bypassed or omitted accidentally given future changes. Now, the code could be structured as follows:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        TransformInSomeWay(input);             while(!ProcessingComplete(input))        {           DoSomethingElseTo(input);           TransformInSomeWay(input);        }     }      However, this duplicates a call to a method in code, violating DRY; if `TransformInSomeWay` were later replaced with some other method, both calls would have to be found and changed (and the fact that there are two may be less obvious in a more complex piece of code). You could also write it like:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        var complete = false;        while(!complete)        {           TransformInSomeWay(input);                complete = ProcessingComplete(input);                if(!complete)            {              DoSomethingElseTo(input);                     }        }     }      ... but you now have a variable whose only purpose is to shift the condition- checking to the loop structure, and also has to be checked multiple times to provide the same behavior as the original logic. For my part, I say that given the algorithm this code implements in the real world, the original code is the most readable. If you were going through it yourself, this is the way you'd think about it, and so it would be intuitive to people familiar with the algorithm. So, which is \"better\"? is it better to give the responsibility of condition checking to the while loop by structuring the logic around the loop? Or is it better to structure the logic in a \"natural\" way as indicated by requirements or a conceptual description of the algorithm, even though that may mean bypassing the loop's built-in capabilities?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Programming", "Python"], "format": "Code Example", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Programming Forum", "instructed_query": "Can you explain the Python case statement?

In this paper we employ an LSTM to compositionally capture the semantics of relational text. We dramatically demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by evaluating in a multilingual setting, in which the English training data entities overlap with the seed KB, but the Spanish text does not. Additional improvements are obtained by tying word embeddings across languages. In extensive experiments on the English and Spanish TAC KBP benchmark, our techniques provide substantial accuracy improvements.

The compression scheme uses a semistatic word-based model and a Huffman code where the coding alphabet is byte-oriented rather than bit-oriented. We compress typical English texts to about 30% of their original size, against 40% and 35% for Compress and Gzip, respectively. Compression time is close to that of Compress and approximately half of the time of Gzip, and decompression time is lower than that of Gzip and one third of that of Compress. We present three algorithms to search the compressed text. They allow a large number of variations over the basic word and phrase search capability, such as sets of characters, arbitrary regular expressions, and approximate matching. Separators and stopwords can be discarded at search time without significantly increasing the cost. When searching for simple words, the experiments show that running our algorithms on a compressed text is twice as fast as running the best existing software on the uncompressed version of the same text. When searching complex or approximate patterns, our algorithms are up to 8 times faster than the search on uncompressed text.

However, investments in online personalization may be severely undermined if consumers do not use these services due to privacy concerns. In the absence of any empirical evidence that seeks to understand this consumer dilemma, our research develops a parsimonious model to predict consumers’ usage of online personalization as a result of the tradeoff between their value for personalization and concern for privacy. In addition to this tradeoff, we find that a consumer’s intent to use personalization services is positively influenced by her trust in the vendor.

As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a \"heartbeat\"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Data Compression", "Text Analysis", "Memes"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Research Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore the Record-Aware Two-Level Compression for Big Textual Data Analysis Acceleration in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

The growing volume of such data creates challenges for data analysis including efficient and scalable algorithm, effective computing platforms and energy efficiency. Compression is a standard method for reducing data size but current standard compression algorithms are destructive to the organisation of data contents. This work introduces Content-aware, Partial Compression (CaPC) for text using a dictionary-based approach. We simply use shorter codes to replace strings while maintaining the original data format and structure, so that the compressed contents can be directly consumed by analytic platforms. We evaluate our approach with a set of real-world datasets and several classical MapReduce jobs on Hadoop. We also provide a supplementary utility library for Hadoop, hence, existing MapReduce programs can be used directly on the compressed datasets with little or no modification. In evaluation, we demonstrate that CaPC works well with a wide variety of data analysis scenarios, experimental results show ~30% average data size reduction, and up to ~32% performance increase on some I/O intensive jobs on an in-house Hadoop cluster. While the gains may seem modest, the point is that these gains are 'for free' and act as supplementary to all other optimizations.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Data Compression", "Text Analysis", "Big Data"], "format": "Research Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Academic Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore Record-Aware Two-Level Compression for Big Textual Data Analysis Acceleration in a research paper written in English aimed at researchers.", "reversed_query": "Explore Record-Aware Two-Level Compression for Big Textual Data Analysis Acceleration but do not present it in a research paper written in English aimed at researchers."}

Here on stackoverflow, one can find questions about when not to use SQL, but are there any scenarios when one should avoid using NoSQL databases?

HSI data often lie on sparse, nonlinear manifolds whose geometric and topological structures can be exploited via manifold-learning techniques. In this article, we focused on demonstrating the opportunities provided by manifold learning for classification of remotely sensed data. However, limitations and opportunities remain both for research and applications. Although these methods have been demonstrated to mitigate the impact of physical effects that affect electromagnetic energy traversing the atmosphere and reflecting from a target, nonlinearities are not always exhibited in the data, particularly at lower spatial resolutions, so users should always evaluate the inherent nonlinearity in the data. Manifold learning is data driven, and as such, results are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the data, and one method will not consistently provide the best results. Nonlinear manifold-learning methods require parameter tuning, although experimental results are typically stable over a range of values, and have higher computational overhead than linear methods, which is particularly relevant for large-scale remote sensing data sets. Opportunities for advancing manifold learning also exist for analysis of hyperspectral and multisource remotely sensed data. Manifolds are assumed to be inherently smooth, an assumption that some data sets may violate, and data often contain classes whose spectra are distinctly different, resulting in multiple manifolds or submanifolds that cannot be readily integrated with a single manifold representation. Developing appropriate characterizations that exploit the unique characteristics of these submanifolds for a particular data set is an open research problem for which hierarchical manifold structures appear to have merit. To date, most work in manifold learning has focused on feature extraction from single images, assuming stationarity across the scene. Research is also needed in joint exploitation of global and local embedding methods in dynamic, multitemporal environments and integration with semisupervised and active learning.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Remote Sensing", "Hyperspectral Imaging", "Machine Learning"], "format": "Journal Article", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Scientific Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore Active-Metric Learning for Classification of Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Images in a long English journal article aimed at researchers from a scientific journal.", "reversed_query": "Explore Active-Metric Learning for Classification of Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Images in a short article not in English and not aimed at researchers from a non-scientific journal."}

Under misspeci cation of the parametric model, the optimal choice of the weight function is asymptotically shown to be the ratio of the density function of the covariate in the population to that in the observations. This is the pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation of sample surveys. The optimality is de ned by the expected Kullback–Leibler loss, and the optimal weight is obtained by considering the importance sampling identity.

This overfitting is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random “dropout” gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition. A feedforward, artificial neural network uses layers of non-linear hidden units between its inputs and its outputs. By adapting the weights on the incoming connections of these hidden units it learns feature detectors that enable it to predict the correct output when given an input vector [15]. If the relationship between the input and the correct output is complicated and the network has enough hidden units to model it accurately, there will typically be many different settings of the weights that can model the training set almost perfectly, especially if there is only a limited amount of labeled training data. Each of these weight vectors will make different predictions on held-out test data and almost all of them will do worse on the test data than on the training data because the feature detectors have been tuned to work well together on the training data but not on the test data. Overfitting can be reduced by using “dropout” to prevent complex co-adaptations on the training data. On each presentation of each training case, each hidden unit is randomly omitted from the network with a probability of 0.5, so a hidden unit cannot rely on other hidden units being present. Another way to view the dropout procedure is as a very efficient way of performing model averaging with neural networks. A good way to reduce the error on the test set is to average the predictions produced by a very large number of different networks. The standard way to do this is to train many separate networks and then to apply each of these networks to the test data, but this is computationally expensive during both training and testing. Random dropout makes it possible to train a huge number of different networks in a reasonable time. There is almost certainly a different network for each presentation of each training case but all of these networks share the same weights for the hidden units that are present. We use the standard, stochastic gradient descent procedure for training the dropout neural networks on mini-batches of training cases, but we modify the penalty term that is normally used to prevent the weights from growing too large. Instead of penalizing the squared length (L2 norm) of the whole weight vector, we set an upper bound on the L2 norm of the incoming weight vector for each individual hidden unit. If a weight-update violates this constraint, we renormalize the weights of the hidden unit by division. Using a constraint rather than a penalty prevents weights from growing very large no matter how large the proposed weight-update is.

This paper explores the application of Bacterial Foraging Optimization to the problem of mobile robot navigation to determine shortest feasible path to move from any current position to target position in unknown environment with moving obstacles. It develops a new algorithm based on Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) technique. This algorithm finds a path towards the target and avoiding the obstacles using particles which are randomly distributed on a circle around a robot. The criterion on which it selects the best particle is the distance to target and the Gaussian cost function of the particle. Then, a high level decision strategy is used for the selection and thus proceeds for the result. It works on local environment by using a simple robot sensor. So, it is free from having generated additional map which adds cost. Furthermore, it can be implemented without requirement to tuning algorithm and complex calculation. To simulate the algorithm, the program is written in C language and the environment is created by OpenGL. To test the efficiency of proposed technique, results are compared with Basic Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) and another well-known algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

This result, which implicitly was already included in our earlier works on torqueand position control, can also be seized for the design of impedance controllers. For impedance control, furthermore, potential shaping is of special interest. It is shown how, based only on the motor angles, a potential function can be designed which simultaneously incorporates gravity compensation and a desired Cartesian stiffness relation for the link angles.

We are dealing with work orders that are needed to maintain equipment. We have a bit of a disagreement in regards to the structure of the contract. There are two methods on my side, I would like a single work order class with all properties related to the work order in it. example (simplified)               WO - class       Number - property       Description - property       WarrantyStatus - property       WarrantySettlementDate - property       LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] - list property       Children<WO>[] - list property      On their side, they want to create a work order class, but for each logical group of data, they want to create another class to wrap the properties. example (simplified)               WO - class       WOHeader - class         Number - property         Description - property       Warranty - class         WarrantyStatus - property         WarrantySettlementDate - property       LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] - list property       Children<WO>[] - list property      Now they will have approx 8 classes in the full definition that they want to create all with a few properties in each. This seems a bit over the top to me and has a bit of a code smell or anti pattern feel to it. For my example, I have two classes, WO and LabourStep. They have 4 classes for the same thing WO,WOHeader,Warranty,LabourStep. There will only ever be one WOHeader per WO and the same for Warranty. My one seems far simpler to manage changes (add a new property to WO and thats it), but is less human readable. On their side, The structure is a little more easier to read by a human, but it feel like its pushing a logical view onto the contract the doesn't really belong. And to add a new property potentially requires a modification to the WO and the creation of a new class if a new logical group was added. These extra classes are only there to group properties. What is the right way to go? ======EDIT========== Frank - I completely agree with your thoughts and it is the way I approach my development. Except in this case, the third party monolithic enterprise system we are integrating with has been written in a very generic way to try and cater for as many businesses as possible. The data is spread across three tables in a one to one mapping with the majority in one table. There is barely any validation. There is no concept of a \"Warranty\" object/thing in that system. Its just 3 properties against a WO. All the web service will do is act like a data store, with the WO persisted as a whole. e.g. getWO() updateWO() createWO(). There will never be get/updateWarranty() methods. It's all just one blob of data to read/persist. On our side, we never use the result directly from web services even if they are our own. We convert them into proper models and then use those. To us a data contract is very different to a model. There is no business logic in the data contract, its purely a container to get data from one part of the system to another without closely coupling them. That means we can easily change to persist to a database instead of a web service and all its needs to do is match the interface of the web service. This also allows us to modify our own models which may even include results from multiple web services without having to worry about being restricted to or changing the format of the data contracts. So when I think in those terms, Having the data contracts split into WOHeader or WOWarranty classes just doesn't make any sense. It will never used in that way, not even by them. Its just there for a nice logical group of properties that mean nothing by themselves. A region block around those properties would have the same net effect. Labour steps and equipment details however, make a lot of sense to be in separate classes as they are separate entities and not just properties of work orders.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Design", "Interface", "Data Structure"], "format": "Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Forum", "instructed_query": "In a long discussion on a forum, should interface only be used for behavior and not to show logical data grouped together?

Several techniques are investigated for combining both spatial and spectral information. Spatial information is extracted at the object (set of pixels) level rather than at the conventional pixel level. Mathematical morphology is first used to derive the morphological profile of the image, which includes characteristics about the size, orientation, and contrast of the spatial structures present in the image. Then, the morphological neighborhood is defined and used to derive additional features for classification. Classification is performed with support vector machines (SVMs) using the available spectral information and the extracted spatial information. Spatial postprocessing is next investigated to build more homogeneous and spatially consistent thematic maps. To that end, three presegmentation techniques are applied to define regions that are used to regularize the preliminary pixel-wise thematic map. Finally, a multiple-classifier (MC) system is defined to produce relevant markers that are exploited to segment the hyperspectral image with the minimum spanning forest algorithm. Experimental results conducted on three real hyperspectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions and corresponding to various contexts are presented. They highlight the importance of spectral-spatial strategies for the accurate classification of hyperspectral images and validate the proposed methods.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Machine Learning", "Remote Sensing", "Hyperspectral Imaging"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore the learning of sensor-specific spatial-spectral features of hyperspectral images via convolutional neural networks in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

Although the majority of Web content is in English, it also shows great promise as a source of multilingual content. Using figures from the Babel survey of multilinguality on the Web (h tZp : / /www. i s o c . o r g / ) , it is possible to estimate that as of June, 1997, there were on the order of 63000 primarily non-English Web servers, ranging over 14 languages. Moreover, a followup investigation of the non-English servers suggests that nearly a third contain some useful cross-language data, such as parallel English on the page or links to parallel English pages the follow-up also found pages in five languages not identified by the Babel study (Catalan, Chinese, Hungarian, Icelandic, and Arabic; Michael Littman, personal communication). Given the continued explosive increase in the size of the Web, the trend toward business organizations that cross national boundaries, and high levels of competition for consumers in a global marketplace, it seems impossible not to view multilingual content on the Web as an expanding resource.

And Gey et al., also at TREC-7, observed that in doing cross-language retrieval using commercial machine translation systems, gaps in the lexicon (their example was acupuncture/Akupunktur) could make the difference between precision of 0.08 and precision of 0.83 on individual queries. ttesnik (1998) presented an algorithm called", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Machine Translation", "Natural Language Processing"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Conference Proceedings", "instructed_query": "Explore the improved statistical machine translation using monolingually-derived paraphrases in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

When studies attempt to group queries together by task or session, a timeout is typically used to identify the boundary. However, users query search engines in order to accomplish tasks at a variety of granularities, issuing multiple queries as they attempt to accomplish tasks. In this work we study real sessions manually labeled into hierarchical tasks, and show that timeouts, whatever their length, are of limited utility in identifying task boundaries, achieving a maximum precision of only 70%. We report on properties of this search task hierarchy, as seen in a random sample of user interactions from a major web search engine's log, annotated by human editors, learning that 17% of tasks are interleaved, and 20% are hierarchically organized. No previous work has analyzed or addressed automatic identification of interleaved and hierarchically organized search tasks. We propose and evaluate a method for the automated segmentation of users' query streams into hierarchical units. Our classifiers can improve on timeout segmentation, as well as other previously published approaches, bringing the accuracy up to 92% for identifying fine-grained task boundaries, and 89-97% for identifying pairs of queries from the same task when tasks are interleaved hierarchically. This is the first work to identify, measure and automatically segment sequences of user queries into their hierarchical structure. The ability to perform this kind of segmentation paves the way for evaluating search engines in terms of user task completion.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Information Retrieval", "Search Engine", "User Behavior"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal", "instructed_query": "Explore ways to support complex search tasks in an academic paper written in English for researchers.

Since developing this standard, the Joint Video Team of the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has also standardized an extension of that technology that is referred to as multiview video coding (MVC). MVC provides a compact representation for multiple views of a video scene, such as multiple synchronized video cameras. Stereo-paired video for 3-D viewing is an important special case of MVC. The standard enables inter-view prediction to improve compression capability, as well as supporting ordinary temporal and spatial prediction. It also supports backward compatibility with existing legacy systems by structuring the MVC bitstream to include a compatible “base view.” Each other view is encoded at the same picture resolution as the base view. In recognition of its high-quality encoding capability and support for backward compatibility, the stereo high profile of the MVC extension was selected by the Blu-Ray Disc Association as the coding format for 3-D video with high-definition resolution. This paper provides an overview of the algorithmic design used for extending H.264/MPEG-4 AVC towards MVC. The basic approach of MVC for enabling inter-view prediction and view scalability in the context of H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is reviewed. Related supplemental enhancement information (SEI) metadata is also described. Various “frame compatible” approaches for support of stereo-view video as an alternative to MVC are also discussed.

In Joel Spolsky's famous (or infamous) article Thins You Should Never Do, Part I, he makes the case that doing a rewrite is always a wrong move because:   1. It automatically puts you behind (your competitors/schedule/etc.)   2. The code probably isn't as bad as the programmers believe (anything someone else wrote is always a mess, although some are bigger messes than others - and even then)   3. It's probably easier/quicker/cheaper to fix what's truly wrong with it than to rewrite from scratch.   4. In rewriting from scratch, you are probably going to re-introduce bugs that were fixed in previous versions the original code. Instead, he recommends fixing what's wrong with the code. I assume this is a good summary of his post, and I'll postulate that it is generally true. I'm trying to collect a set of rules/guideline for my team, and one of them (based on Joel's article) is               We don’t re-write ... ever!      - But we can refactor large portions of the code.       (this exception takes care of ugly/problematic code issues)      One question that has cropped up is \"What about when technology changes and you can no longer get support for older versions?\". This is what I think of as the Sisyphean Upgrade path. E.g., I recall when Oracle moved from SQL*Forms 2.x/3.x through to Forms 6i and beyond, Forms that were originality developed in the old .inp format were no longer supported with the current version of Oracle and Oracle Forms. So you had a choice of sticking with an unsupported database with unsupported tools or rewriting the Forms from scratch (or converted with 3rd party tools and then gone over with a fine toothed comb). Which I will call porting, particularly when you are doing a faithful line by line/function by function translation into the new tech and not adding any functionality. The rule then became:               We don’t re-write ... ever!     - But we can refactor large portions of the code.     - And we can port the code to a new platform when we *truly* have no other        choice.      (and by truly I mean, you can't even buy your way out of the problem for 2x the cost of porting it) Are there any other exceptions that I've missed?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Engineering", "Legacy Systems"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Tech Blog", "instructed_query": "How can I sell a legacy program rewrite to the business?

Specifically, as hand-held devices are carried by human beings, we leverage two key social phenomena, namely social trust and social reciprocity, to promote efficient cooperation among devices. With this insight, we develop a coalitional game theoretic framework to devise social-tie based cooperation strategies for device-to-device communications. We also develop a network assisted relay selection mechanism to implement the coalitional game solution, and show that the mechanism is immune to group deviations, individually rational, and truthful.

Applications include the continuous authentication of radio and TV Internet broadcasts, and authenticated data distribution by satellite. The main challenges are fourfold. First, authenticity must be guaranteed even when only the sender of the data is trusted. Second, the scheme needs to scale to potentially millions of receivers. Third, streamed media distribution can have high packet loss. Finally, the system needs to be efficient to support fast packet rates. We propose two efficient schemes, TESLA and EMSS, for secure lossy multicast streams. TESLA, short for Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication, offers sender authentication, strong loss robustness, high scalability, and minimal overhead, at the cost of loose initial time synchronization and slightly delayed authentication. EMSS, short for Efficient Multi-chained Stream Signature, provides nonrepudiation of origin, high loss resistance, and low overhead, at the cost of slightly delayed verification.

Deviceto- device (D2D) communications is a promising technique to provide wireless peer-to-peer services and enhance spectrum utilization in the LTE-Advanced networks. In D2D communications, the user equipments (UEs) are allowed to directly communicate between each other by reusing the cellular resources rather than using uplink and downlink resources in the cellular mode when communicating via the base station. However, enabling D2D communications in a cellular network poses two major challenges. First, the interference caused to the cellular users by D2D devices could critically affect the performances of the cellular devices. Second, the minimum quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of D2D communications need to be guaranteed. In this article, we introduce a novel resource allocation scheme (i.e. joint resource block scheduling and power control) for D2D communications in LTE-Advanced networks to maximize the spectrum utilization while addressing the above challenges. First, an overview of LTE-Advanced networks, and architecture and signaling support for provisioning of D2D communications in these networks are described. Furthermore, research issues and the current state-of-the-art of D2D communications are discussed. Then, a resource allocation scheme based on a column generation method is proposed for D2D communications. The objective is to maximize the spectrum utilization by finding the minimum transmission length in terms of time slots for D2D links while protecting the cellular users from harmful interference and guaranteeing the QoS of D2D links.

We present a framework that capitalizes on temporal structure in unlabeled video to learn to anticipate human actions and objects. The key idea behind our approach is that we can train deep networks to predict the visual representation of images in the future. Visual representations are a promising prediction target because they encode images at a higher semantic level than pixels yet are automatic to compute.

The performance advantage of this probabilistic matching technique over standard Euclidean nearest-neighbor eigenface matching was demonstrated using results from DARPA’s 1996 “FERET” face recognition competition, in which this Bayesian matching algorithm was found to be the top performer. In addition, we derive a simple method of replacing costly computation of nonlinear (on-line) Bayesian similarity measures by inexpensive linear (off-line) subspace projections and simple Euclidean norms, thus resulting in a significant computational speed-up for implementation with very large databases.

Traditionally, only binary relations have been extracted from large numbers of published papers. Recently, more complex relations (biomolecular events) have also been extracted. Such events may include several entities or other relations. To evaluate the performance of the text mining systems, several shared task challenges have been arranged for the BioNLP community. With a common and consistent task setting, the BioNLP'09 shared task evaluated complex biomolecular events such as binding and regulation.Finding these events automatically is important in order to improve biomedical event extraction systems. In the present paper, we propose an automatic event extraction system, which contains a model for complex events, by solving a classification problem with rich features. The main contributions of the present paper are: (1) the proposal of an effective bio-event detection method using machine learning, (2) provision of a high-performance event extraction system, and (3) the execution of a quantitative error analysis.

Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style \"push-relabel\" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style \"augmenting paths.\" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation.

The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers[6]. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems.

Abstract We investigate the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in computer vision. SVM is a learning technique developed by V. Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs.) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classi ers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Machine Learning", "Ground Penetrating Radar"], "format": "Conference Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Proceedings of CVPR", "instructed_query": "Discuss Buried Object Detection from B-Scan Ground Penetrating Radar Data Using Faster-RCNN in a long conference paper written in English for researchers, suitable for the Proceedings of CVPR.", "reversed_query": "Discuss Buried Object Detection from B-Scan Ground Penetrating Radar Data Using Faster-RCNN but do not present it in a long conference paper written in English for researchers, nor suitable for the Proceedings of CVPR."}

Although the advent of these techniques has gradually enabled clarification of the functional contributions of the prefrontal cortex in deception with respect to executive function, the specific roles of subregions within the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions responsible for emotional regulation or social interactions during deception are still unclear. Assuming that the processes of falsifying truthful responses and deceiving others are differentially associated with the activities of these regions, we conducted a positron emission tomography experiment with 2 (truth, lie) 2 (honesty, dishonesty) factorial design. The main effect of falsifying the truthful responses revealed increased brain activity of the left dorsolateral and right anterior prefrontal cortices, supporting the interpretation of previous studies that executive functions are related to making untruthful responses. The main effect of deceiving the interrogator showed activations of the ventromedial prefrontal (medial orbitofrontal) cortex and amygdala, adding new evidence that the brain regions assumed to be responsible for emotional processing or social interaction are active during deceptive behavior similar to that in real-life situations. Further analysis revealed that activity of the right anterior prefrontal cortex showed both effects of deception, indicating that this region has a pivotal role in telling lies.

Taken separately, specific studies vary in task dimensions and in type(s) of emotion studied and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity. By examining findings across studies, we sought to determine if common or segregated patterns of activations exist across various emotional tasks. We reviewed 55 PET and fMRI activation studies (yielding 761 individual peaks) which investigated emotion in healthy subjects. Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings. We divided the brain into 20 nonoverlapping regions, and characterized each region by its responsiveness across individual emotions (positive, negative, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust), to different induction methods (visual, auditory, recall/imagery), and in emotional tasks with and without cognitive demand. Our review yielded the following summary observations: (1) The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing; (2) fear specifically engaged the amygdala; (3) sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate; (4) emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala; (5) induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula; (6) emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula.

Furthermore, the track-stair interactive forces are complicated, which may take the forms of grouser-tread hooking force, track--stair edge frictional force, grouser-riser clutching force, and even their compositions. In this paper, the track--stair interactions are analyzed systematically, and tipover stability criteria are derived for a tracked mobile robot climbing stairs.

Tracks are efficient on uneven terrains or on soft surfaces (snow, mud, etc.), while wheels are optimal on flat surfaces. Our objective is to work on a new concept capable of combining different locomotion mechanisms to increase the locomotion capabilities of the robotic platform. The design we came up with, called AZIMUT, is symmetrical and is made of four independent leg-track-wheel articulations. It can move with its articulations up, down or straight, allowing the robot to deal with three-dimensional environments. AZIMUT is also capable of moving sideways without changing its orientation, making it omnidirectional. By putting sensors on these articulations, the robot can also actively perceive its environment by changing the orientation of its articulations. Designing a robot with such capabilities requires addressing difficult design compromises, with measurable impacts seen only after integrating all of the components together.

Our model consists of a fully convolutional neural network which, unlike most existing convolutional neural networks, is able to process images of any dimensions and aspect ratio as input, and outputs a simplified sketch which has the same dimensions as the input image. In order to teach our model to simplify, we present a new dataset of pairs of rough and simplified sketch drawings. By leveraging convolution operators in combination with efficient use of our proposed dataset, we are able to train our sketch simplification model. Our approach naturally overcomes the limitations of existing methods, e.g., vector images as input and long computation time; and we show that meaningful simplifications can be obtained for many different test cases.

The effect of magnetization direction, number of stator slots and current waveform on torque pulsation are examined. A three-phase, four-pole IPM motor is considered for the study. The finite element method is used to calculate the torque, reluctance torque, back iron flux density, tooth flux density, detent torque and back-EMF of the motor. It is shown that because of the reluctance torque resulting from rotor saliency, the peak point in the torque-angle curve is shifted to the left.

Mobility is a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society strives for safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs. Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs among societies, depending on their culture and their degree of industrialization. A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors, such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence. These steps are considered important for the interim period, until reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal and market trends.

{"dataset": "beir/cqadupstack/programmers", "query_id": "135047", "query": "New to TDD. Should I avoid private methods now?", "document": "I very often hear the following: \"If you want to test private methods, you'd better put that in another class and expose it.\" While sometimes that's the case and we have a hiding concept inside our class, other times you end up with classes that have the same attributes (or, worst, every attribute of one class become a argument on a method in the other class) and exposes functionality that is, in fact, implementation detail. Specially on TDD, when you **refactor** a class with public methods out of a previous tested class, that class is now part of your interface, but has no tests to it (since you refactored it, and is a implementation detail). Now, I may be not finding an obvious better answer, but if my answer is the \"correct\", that means that sometimes writting unit tests can break encapsulation, and divide the same responsibility into different classes. A simple example would be testing a setter method when a getter is not actually needed for anything in the real code. Please when aswering don't provide simple answers to specific cases I may have written. Rather, try to explain more of the generic case and theoretical approach. And this is neither language specific. Thanks in advance. **EDIT:** The answer given by Matthew Flynn was really insightful, but didn't quite answer the question. Altough he made the fair point that you either don't test private methods or extract them because they really are other concern and responsibility (or at least that was what I could understand from his answer), I think there are situations where unit testing private methods is useful. My primary example is when you have a class that has one responsibility but the output (or input) that it gives (takes) is just to complex. For example, a hashing function. There's no good way to break a hashing function apart and mantain cohesion and encapsulation. However, testing a hashing function can be really tough, since you would need to calculate by hand (you can't use code calculation to test code calculation!) the hashing, and test multiple cases where the hash changes. In that way (and this may be a question worth of its own topic) I think private method testing is the best way to handle it. Now, I'm not sure if I should ask another question, or ask it here, but are there any better way to test such complex output (input)? OBS: Please, if you think I should ask another question on that topic, leave a comment. :) **EDIT2:** I accepted a answer as my correct because it made me think and decide my course of action, altough it didn't answered my queston completely. But for those who face the same problem as I do (one cohesive class that will change together, but is still too hard to test by itsfelf), I'll tell what I did and why. I decided that the output of that class is simply too hard to a computer to test correctly, so I didn't test it. I could have used a framework to test it's private methods (which would be the best idea, I think), but I didn't want to get to that point. If you are wondering what it is that is cohesive and respects SRP, and still is too hard to a computer to test, I'll give some examples: heightmap generation, hashing functions, procedural music generation (you can test some units, but the highest level unit is simply too subjective).", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Software Development", "Testing", "TDD"], "format": "Forum Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "StackOverflow", "instructed_query": "As a developer new to TDD, should I avoid private methods now?

{"dataset": "beir/cqadupstack/programmers", "query_id": "193929", "query": "\"Too object-oriented\"", "document": "I've been recently assigned for a new high-performance C++ project (finance) together with 3 other guys who, like, me, refer to themselves as \"primarily C/C++ programmers\", meaning, all of us have also done Java & other stuff, we all have comparable experience (8 to 10 years) and have successfully collaborated for the making of other projects (not C/C++). I soon found out we have such different mindsets when it comes to our \"mother programming tongue\" that it risks not only the good delivery of the project but also the general well-being of the team/office. Specifically: They come from an electrical engineering/automation/polytechnic type of background, so their reasoning is intimately related to how hardware works, how bytes move around, processor workings, instruction caching, generally everything at the lower layers. They did embedded programming, ARM programming (I barely know what those are). I soon found out their practical experience is with mostly C, not C++. They think procedurally, not OOP. I, on the other hand, have trained myself to think in a more abstract way, to apply principles such as encapsulation, low coupling/high cohesion for creating reusable, modular software. My speciality is the C++ programming language, with an accent on language constructs that help you get both fast and reusable, generic code. I think design patterns, idioms, concepts. Throughout 9 years of developing software I consistently witnessed how poor maintainability of software systems is by far the #1 burden of teams. I generously document my code, write careful interfaces. I embrace template meta-programming as a way to obtain fast and reusable products. I embrace the new C++11 standard features. Where I see reusability and loose coupling, they see \"complication\". They want to \"see it all there\". They want to see `char*`, not some buffer class in interface methods. At one point one even said \"I don't care how simple your interfaces are if your implementation looks complicated\". The trouble is, we really are trying to transition from a monolithic style of systems to a reusable one - we are writing a library. Yet they don't wish to see their C-style structs being polluted with templated methods, typedefs and c-tors, even if neither makes their structs non-POD. They also don't wish to see static_assert(std::is_pod<...>). They love memcpy and pointers and generally stay away from references. They tend to think typedefs are somehow evil. I really tried to make them see an abstraction for what it is. It is code together with data it operates on. By necessity, a library needs to define some interfaces for the user to be able to plug it into a larger product. They tend to see these interfaces as ways in which my code _requires their code behave/look as I wish and doesn't allow them to do things their way_ , but without actually telling me a specific functionality they can't obtain. Make no mistake, I'm no ignorant when it comes to performance. I know about cache lines, branch prediction, the overhead of method virtualization, heap allocation, hash lookups. I'm good with complexity of algorithms (though that doesn't matter so much here), data structures, inlining and some other compiler optimizations such as RVO. I believe with a modern compiler a reusable, layered OOP C++ product can get within 10% of the performance of a C-only monolithic product, when carefully written and optimized. I honestly believed we would complement each other in our thinking. What are your thoughts?

This violates encapsulation. Only the object itself should care about its internal state.

I don't get it. Imagine we're creating a multiplayer dungeon crawl (a roguelike) using FP where we emphasize pure functions and immutable data structures. We generate a dungeon composed of rooms, corridors, heroes, monsters and loot. Our world is effectively an object graph of structures and their relationships. As things change our representation of the world is amended to reflect those changes. Our hero kills a rat, picks up a shortsword, etc. To me the world (current reality) carries this idea of state and I'm missing how FP overcomes this. As our hero takes action, functions amend the state of the world. It appears to be every decision (AI or human) needs to be based on the state of the world as it is in the present. Where would we allow for concurrency? We can't have multiple processes concurrently ammending the state of the world lest one process base its outcomes on some expired state. It feels to me that all control should occur within a single control loop so that we're always processing the present state represented by our current object graph of the world. Clearly there are situations perfectly suited for concurrency (i.e. When processing isolated tasks whose states are independent of one another). I'm failing to see how concurrency is useful in my example and that may be the issue. I may be misrepresenting the claim somehow.

My impression is that projects using a DI framework like Spring or Guice tend to lose their object orientation and degenerate to a purely procedural design:   1. DI not only centralizes the question of which implementation of an object to use but also manages the life-cycle of these objects. Many OO **design patterns** , however, rely on the ability of business logic to wire objects. I wouldn't know, for example, how to implement a Strategy Pattern in Spring because the decision which of the concrete strategies to use, is statically determined by the configuration of the application instead of a piece of code. Same goes for decorator, composite, observer, ...   2. The reason above leads to a design where functionality and data are separated. Because you don't want to let the DI container decide when data is created, you split any code off the data in order to have only this part managed by the DI container. This is contrary to the idea of OO where **code and data should reside together** in one unit. This breaks the **encapsulation of data** because all fields of the data \"beans\" are exposed by public getters and setters.   3. You can't use **polymorphism** anymore because code is not linked to its data anymore and the \"virtual functions\" can't work. This leads to those instanceof cascades that we all know we shouldn't use. Also, we lose all those designs that rely on polymorphism.   4. The DI container will inject managed beans only in objects which are also managed by it. So you can't **mix managed beans and normal objects** because there can't be any \"non-managed gaps\" in the reference chain of managed beans. So once you started with DI, you need to put all other code under the control of the DI container and you can't use normal objects anymore. I suppose that this is the reason why the separation of code and data is done so rigorously in DI projects. I see that there are reasons why to use DI but is it really worth giving up so much? Don't people care about OO? Apart from this **article** , I can't find any discussions on this topic. Or is it just me who doesn't understand how to do this properly? Any ideas how the four points above can be tackled with? **Appendix 1: Explanation of strategy pattern** I refer to the example here. Let's assume there's a DI version of it where all implementations of `Strategy` and the `Context` are injected to `StrategyExample`. Then `StrategyExample` doesn't decide anymore which `Strategy` to inject into `Context` but the configuration would have already decided which implementation to inject into `Context`. So yes, DI heavily applies the Strategy Pattern. But it always does so statically.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Engineering", "Design Patterns"], "format": "Forum Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "StackOverflow", "instructed_query": "Does 'Inversion of Control' promote 'Anemic Domain Model'?

Is there a good rule of thumb?", "document": "I want to introduce the concept of unit tests (and testing in general) to my co-workers; right now there are no tests at all and things are tested by actually performing the tasks via the UI to see the desired result.

Due to changed requirements, I have been asked to modify a module I previously wrote and that is fairly loosely coupled (not as much as I would like, but as best I can get without having to introduce a lot of other concepts). I've decided to include a suite of unit tests with my revised code to \"prove\" that it works as expected and demonstrate how testing works; I'm not following true TDD as some of the code is already written but I'm hoping to follow some TDD concepts for the new code I'll have to create. Now, inevitably I'm sure I'll be asked why it's taking me more than a day or two to write the code, since parts of what I'll be interacting with already exist in the system (albeit without any tests and very tightly coupled), and when I check the code in I'll be asked just what this \"Tests\" project is. I can explain the basics of testing, but I can't explain the actual benefits in a way the others would understand (because they think testing requires you to run the app yourself, since often the actual UI matters in determining if the feature \"works\" or not). They don't understand the idea of loose coupling (clearly evident by the fact nothing is loosely coupled; there aren't even any interfaces outside of the code I've written), so trying to use that as a benefit would probably earn me a \"Huh?\" kind of look, and again I can't be as loose as I would like to without having to rework several existing modules and probably introduce some kind of IoC container, which would be viewed as wasting time and not \"programming\".

The types of applications I am developing always have a custom aspect to them. So there will always be some code written which is client specific for every project. The method we are using now is as follows: Several 'CORE' projects exist in isolation from one another, each core project is a class library which is capable of running on its own, or with dependencies on other core modules. All of these core modules are documented (Sandcastle) and NuGet packages created for them, which are served up via a private NuGet feed. When a customer purchases the software we create a customer specific project which implements the bespoke code that they require, and pulls in the NuGet packages from the core libs as needed. The build of this project is what is provided to the customer, and each customer project has it's own Git repository. This has worked fine for a year or so, but I feel that as we add features to the core libraries the number of nuget packages is growing quite quickly.

I am also extremely familiar with openssl command line tools. However, I have very little experience with web based PKI enabled projects & hence I am trying to design and code a personal project for understanding this better. ## The requirements This is the website for a bank. All Internet Banking users are allowed use any certificate issued by a few known CAs (verisign, Thawte, entrust etc). The Bank is not responsible for procuring certificates for the user. These certificates will be used for authentication to the banks website either instead of or as an add-on to username/password login. The platforms/OS etc are still not fixed. Assume that enrollment has been done - i.e. bank knows the certificate going to be used by each user. ## Design I was wondering what's the best way to do authentication?   1. I saw that Apache has a way to enable 2 way ssl - in this case, i think navigating to the website would automatically ask for a cert from the user. But I am not sure if this is enough because it seems that all it verifies is whether a certificate is signed by a trusted CA & also may be whether it falls in a white list of subject lines of the certificates etc. But this is not enough for a bank case because you need to be able to associate a bankuserid with a certificate.   2. IIS seems to have a way by which I can have a certificate stored for each user in Active Directory. This is what I understood from reading few MSDN articles. You turn on 2 way SSL in IIS & then when the user tries to navigate to the website, IIS will send a request to the browser with a list of approved CAs and browser will let the user pick an appropriate certificate from his certstore and sends it to backend. I am assuming that IIS will do 2 things     * Ensure that the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by under the cover negotiations)     * Based on the AD User-Cert Mapping, IIS will report the username to the application.   3. Do the authentication explicity by calling crypto functions rather depending on depending on the webserver to do it.     * Show a user screen where he uploads a certificate and the application ensures the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by asking the front-end to sign some string using the cert).     * The application has a database some of data is stored which allows each user to be mapped to his userid. This may be      * the whole cert corresponding to each userid     * the CA and cert serial number corresponding to each user id. I was wondering which is the commonly used method?

Both teams are located in India. I am on the west coast of the U.S. I'm finding leading remote teams challenging: First, their command of the English language is weak. Second, I'm having difficultly understanding them through their accents. Third is timing, we are 12 hours apart. We use Skype to communicate. I have a month to get the project done. We've burned through a week just setting up the environments. At this point I'm considering working their hours, 11p PDT to 7a PDT, to get them up to speed, so that I can get the project off the ground. A 12 hour lag time is too much. I'm looking for steps I can take to be successful at leading an offshore team. **Update** The offshore team's primary task is coding, of course, most coding tasks do involve some design work. The offshore team's are composed of one lead, 2 mid level (4 to 5 years) developers and a junior (~2 years) developer. The project is classic waterfall. We've handed the offshore team a business and a technical design document. We are trying to manage the offshore in an agile way. We have daily conference calls with them and I'm requiring the teams to send me a daily scrum in the form of an email answering the following questions:   1. What did I do today?   2. What am I going to do tomorrow?   3. What do I need from Chuck so I can do my job tomorrow? There is some ambiguity in the tasks. The intent was to give them enough direction for them to develop the task with out writing the code for them. I don't have a travel budget. I am using Fogbugz to track the tasks. Each task has been entered into Fogbugz and given a priority. Each team member has access to FogBugz and can choose what task they wish to complete. _Related question_ : What can we do to improve the way outsourcing/offshoring works? **Update 2** I've decided that I can not talk to the team once a day. I must work with them. Starting tonight I've started working the same hours they are. This makes me available to them when they have questions. It also allows me to gain their trust and respect. **Update 3** The project was completed and delivered on time. The key factor was me working the same time as the offshore team. If that had not occurred I'm confident we would have failed. I managed two offshore teams. One of the teams under preformed and I fired them taking on the work myself. Things that lead to success was: Communication, understand their culture and how they communicate. Build rapport with them. A couple of the workers I keep in touch a year after the project completed. Meetings, we met at the beginning of their day so any questions or blocked tasks could be addressed. At the end of the day a daily summary was send out by the worker describing their day and if they encountered any issues. Ideally we could resolve their issues by the start of their next day. Questions, ask questions. Most cases information is not volunteered. Be visible. Being online, available and reachable help fostered the team's commitment to the project. I was not just the daily email. Make it easy. Internally we had a complex QA system in which bugs where tracked. It was complex and hard to use. I paid the $$ for a fogbugz account for each of the team members. Most of the team had used FogBugz and understood the workflow. Daily I would update the fogbugz with new bugs and update the QA system from Fogbugz. **Stackoverflow question** Leading an offshore team", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Manager", "keyword": ["Project Management", "Remote Work"], "format": "Blog Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Personal Blog", "instructed_query": "Here are some tips for managing an offshore development team.

Next week i'll be interviewing some contractors for a 6-month senior Dev position on a project.

The project is an ASP.NET MVC application for an intranet. My personal thought was to have them write a trivial MVC app that pulls some data from a DB during the interview, showing that they can implement a testable, loosely coupled application, but i don't know if this is _too_ trivial. From it i would expect them to have implemented a couple of tests, set up dependency injection, and probably use a repository instead of fat controllers. Any ideas, or is what i'm suggesting a bad idea? The coding part of the interview would likely last about 40 minutes. I timed myself doing what i'd planned and it took me just over half an hour. The candidates would have seen the requirements for the application a couple of days prior to the interview. From thinking about it a bit more, perhaps i should start off with a tightly coupled app, and ask the candidates to refactor it instead, and implement some tests?

Our team is composed of 5 programmers, and 4 of us are new, 1 has more than 3 year experience. We've been working for a program for almost a year now and nobody ever review my code and I was given a page to work with. We never had a code review and we are all new so we don't know what is a clean code looks like. I think programmers learn by themselves? We deployed our program to the program without thorough testing. Now it is tight and we need an approval and code review first before we make changes with the code. For the first time, someone reviews my code and he says it is a mess. I feel so sad and hurt. I really love programming and making them say something like that really hurts me. I really want to improve myself. But it seems like I'm not a genius programmer like in the movies. Can you give me advise on how to be better?

What do I do?", "document": "> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  My Dad is impatient with the pace of my learning to program. What do I do? I am 14 and have been studying programming for 4 months now (3 months Python, 1 Month of Ruby). I haven't been pushed by my parents to do it, I took it up on my own. Whenever I try to show something I made to my dad, he says he finds no value in it. At first, I wrote simple text games, like a text version of rock paper scissors, roulette, blackjack, etc. When that got too easy, I tried to make them as advanced as possible. I made a roulette game in Ruby based off `instance_eval` and `method_missing`. I showed them to him, and he said that was \"childish\" to make games. After games got too easy, I have started extending the features of the languages, I made a module for a \"Changeable Range\" in Python, where one could just write:               j = crange.CRange(5)      then               j.shift(10)      to shift the start and stop up ten and               j.reverse()      to create a reversed range. I showed it to him and he said \"There is no value in that.\" Is there a way to explain to him that there is value in my programs, or am I just moving at a very slow pace in my learning?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Teenager", "keyword": ["Programming", "Learning"], "format": "Forum Post", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "StackOverflow", "instructed_query": "As a teenager, what should I do if my dad is impatient with the pace of my learning to program?
