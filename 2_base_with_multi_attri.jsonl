Due to changed requirements, I have been asked to modify a module I previously wrote and that is fairly loosely coupled (not as much as I would like, but as best I can get without having to introduce a lot of other concepts). I've decided to include a suite of unit tests with my revised code to \"prove\" that it works as expected and demonstrate how testing works; I'm not following true TDD as some of the code is already written but I'm hoping to follow some TDD concepts for the new code I'll have to create. Now, inevitably I'm sure I'll be asked why it's taking me more than a day or two to write the code, since parts of what I'll be interacting with already exist in the system (albeit without any tests and very tightly coupled), and when I check the code in I'll be asked just what this \"Tests\" project is. I can explain the basics of testing, but I can't explain the actual benefits in a way the others would understand (because they think testing requires you to run the app yourself, since often the actual UI matters in determining if the feature \"works\" or not). They don't understand the idea of loose coupling (clearly evident by the fact nothing is loosely coupled; there aren't even any interfaces outside of the code I've written), so trying to use that as a benefit would probably earn me a \"Huh?\" kind of look, and again I can't be as loose as I would like to without having to rework several existing modules and probably introduce some kind of IoC container, which would be viewed as wasting time and not \"programming\".

I am also extremely familiar with openssl command line tools. However, I have very little experience with web based PKI enabled projects & hence I am trying to design and code a personal project for understanding this better. ## The requirements This is the website for a bank. All Internet Banking users are allowed use any certificate issued by a few known CAs (verisign, Thawte, entrust etc). The Bank is not responsible for procuring certificates for the user. These certificates will be used for authentication to the banks website either instead of or as an add-on to username/password login. The platforms/OS etc are still not fixed. Assume that enrollment has been done - i.e. bank knows the certificate going to be used by each user. ## Design I was wondering what's the best way to do authentication?   1. I saw that Apache has a way to enable 2 way ssl - in this case, i think navigating to the website would automatically ask for a cert from the user. But I am not sure if this is enough because it seems that all it verifies is whether a certificate is signed by a trusted CA & also may be whether it falls in a white list of subject lines of the certificates etc. But this is not enough for a bank case because you need to be able to associate a bankuserid with a certificate.   2. IIS seems to have a way by which I can have a certificate stored for each user in Active Directory. This is what I understood from reading few MSDN articles. You turn on 2 way SSL in IIS & then when the user tries to navigate to the website, IIS will send a request to the browser with a list of approved CAs and browser will let the user pick an appropriate certificate from his certstore and sends it to backend. I am assuming that IIS will do 2 things     * Ensure that the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by under the cover negotiations)     * Based on the AD User-Cert Mapping, IIS will report the username to the application.   3. Do the authentication explicity by calling crypto functions rather depending on depending on the webserver to do it.     * Show a user screen where he uploads a certificate and the application ensures the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by asking the front-end to sign some string using the cert).     * The application has a database some of data is stored which allows each user to be mapped to his userid. This may be      * the whole cert corresponding to each userid     * the CA and cert serial number corresponding to each user id. I was wondering which is the commonly used method?

We've burned through a week just setting up the environments.

The offshore team's are composed of one lead, 2 mid level (4 to 5 years) developers and a junior (~2 years) developer. The project is classic waterfall. We've handed the offshore team a business and a technical design document. We are trying to manage the offshore in an agile way. We have daily conference calls with them and I'm requiring the teams to send me a daily scrum in the form of an email answering the following questions:   1. What did I do today?   2. What am I going to do tomorrow?   3. What do I need from Chuck so I can do my job tomorrow? There is some ambiguity in the tasks.

Each team member has access to FogBugz and can choose what task they wish to complete. _Related question_ : What can we do to improve the way outsourcing/offshoring works? **Update 2** I've decided that I can not talk to the team once a day. I must work with them. Starting tonight I've started working the same hours they are. This makes me available to them when they have questions. It also allows me to gain their trust and respect. **Update 3** The project was completed and delivered on time. The key factor was me working the same time as the offshore team. If that had not occurred I'm confident we would have failed. I managed two offshore teams. One of the teams under preformed and I fired them taking on the work myself. Things that lead to success was: Communication, understand their culture and how they communicate. Build rapport with them. A couple of the workers I keep in touch a year after the project completed. Meetings, we met at the beginning of their day so any questions or blocked tasks could be addressed. At the end of the day a daily summary was send out by the worker describing their day and if they encountered any issues. Ideally we could resolve their issues by the start of their next day. Questions, ask questions. Most cases information is not volunteered. Be visible. Being online, available and reachable help fostered the team's commitment to the project. I was not just the daily email. Make it easy. Internally we had a complex QA system in which bugs where tracked. It was complex and hard to use. I paid the $$ for a fogbugz account for each of the team members. Most of the team had used FogBugz and understood the workflow.

Of course each developer has their tasks, but also they have notes that either they or the project leader noted. Those tasks can be like:   1. You should change the flow of this method,    2. I don't like the way you solve this issue,   3. Consider a faster solution   4. etc. Those notes of course can be noted! But laziness is an issue, even if the developer has the abilities required.

Should I avoid private methods now?", "document": "I very often hear the following: \"If you want to test private methods, you'd better put that in another class and expose it.\" While sometimes that's the case and we have a hiding concept inside our class, other times you end up with classes that have the same attributes (or, worst, every attribute of one class become a argument on a method in the other class) and exposes functionality that is, in fact, implementation detail. Specially on TDD, when you **refactor** a class with public methods out of a previous tested class, that class is now part of your interface, but has no tests to it (since you refactored it, and is a implementation detail). Now, I may be not finding an obvious better answer, but if my answer is the \"correct\", that means that sometimes writting unit tests can break encapsulation, and divide the same responsibility into different classes. A simple example would be testing a setter method when a getter is not actually needed for anything in the real code. Please when aswering don't provide simple answers to specific cases I may have written. Rather, try to explain more of the generic case and theoretical approach. And this is neither language specific. Thanks in advance. **EDIT:** The answer given by Matthew Flynn was really insightful, but didn't quite answer the question. Altough he made the fair point that you either don't test private methods or extract them because they really are other concern and responsibility (or at least that was what I could understand from his answer), I think there are situations where unit testing private methods is useful. My primary example is when you have a class that has one responsibility but the output (or input) that it gives (takes) is just to complex. For example, a hashing function. There's no good way to break a hashing function apart and mantain cohesion and encapsulation. However, testing a hashing function can be really tough, since you would need to calculate by hand (you can't use code calculation to test code calculation!) the hashing, and test multiple cases where the hash changes. In that way (and this may be a question worth of its own topic) I think private method testing is the best way to handle it. Now, I'm not sure if I should ask another question, or ask it here, but are there any better way to test such complex output (input)? OBS: Please, if you think I should ask another question on that topic, leave a comment. :) **EDIT2:** I accepted a answer as my correct because it made me think and decide my course of action, altough it didn't answered my queston completely. But for those who face the same problem as I do (one cohesive class that will change together, but is still too hard to test by itsfelf), I'll tell what I did and why. I decided that the output of that class is simply too hard to a computer to test correctly, so I didn't test it. I could have used a framework to test it's private methods (which would be the best idea, I think), but I didn't want to get to that point. If you are wondering what it is that is cohesive and respects SRP, and still is too hard to a computer to test, I'll give some examples: heightmap generation, hashing functions, procedural music generation (you can test some units, but the highest level unit is simply too subjective).", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Software Development", "Testing", "TDD"], "format": "Forum Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "StackOverflow"}

{"dataset": "beir/cqadupstack/programmers", "query_id": "193929", "query": "\"Too object-oriented\"", "document": "I've been recently assigned for a new high-performance C++ project (finance) together with 3 other guys who, like, me, refer to themselves as \"primarily C/C++ programmers\", meaning, all of us have also done Java & other stuff, we all have comparable experience (8 to 10 years) and have successfully collaborated for the making of other projects (not C/C++). I soon found out we have such different mindsets when it comes to our \"mother programming tongue\" that it risks not only the good delivery of the project but also the general well-being of the team/office. Specifically: They come from an electrical engineering/automation/polytechnic type of background, so their reasoning is intimately related to how hardware works, how bytes move around, processor workings, instruction caching, generally everything at the lower layers. They did embedded programming, ARM programming (I barely know what those are). I soon found out their practical experience is with mostly C, not C++. They think procedurally, not OOP. I, on the other hand, have trained myself to think in a more abstract way, to apply principles such as encapsulation, low coupling/high cohesion for creating reusable, modular software. My speciality is the C++ programming language, with an accent on language constructs that help you get both fast and reusable, generic code. I think design patterns, idioms, concepts. Throughout 9 years of developing software I consistently witnessed how poor maintainability of software systems is by far the #1 burden of teams. I generously document my code, write careful interfaces. I embrace template meta-programming as a way to obtain fast and reusable products. I embrace the new C++11 standard features. Where I see reusability and loose coupling, they see \"complication\". They want to \"see it all there\". They want to see `char*`, not some buffer class in interface methods. At one point one even said \"I don't care how simple your interfaces are if your implementation looks complicated\". The trouble is, we really are trying to transition from a monolithic style of systems to a reusable one - we are writing a library. Yet they don't wish to see their C-style structs being polluted with templated methods, typedefs and c-tors, even if neither makes their structs non-POD. They also don't wish to see static_assert(std::is_pod<...>). They love memcpy and pointers and generally stay away from references. They tend to think typedefs are somehow evil. I really tried to make them see an abstraction for what it is. It is code together with data it operates on. By necessity, a library needs to define some interfaces for the user to be able to plug it into a larger product. They tend to see these interfaces as ways in which my code _requires their code behave/look as I wish and doesn't allow them to do things their way_ , but without actually telling me a specific functionality they can't obtain. Make no mistake, I'm no ignorant when it comes to performance. I know about cache lines, branch prediction, the overhead of method virtualization, heap allocation, hash lookups. I'm good with complexity of algorithms (though that doesn't matter so much here), data structures, inlining and some other compiler optimizations such as RVO. I believe with a modern compiler a reusable, layered OOP C++ product can get within 10% of the performance of a C-only monolithic product, when carefully written and optimized.

My impression is that projects using a DI framework like Spring or Guice tend to lose their object orientation and degenerate to a purely procedural design:   1. DI not only centralizes the question of which implementation of an object to use but also manages the life-cycle of these objects. Many OO **design patterns** , however, rely on the ability of business logic to wire objects. I wouldn't know, for example, how to implement a Strategy Pattern in Spring because the decision which of the concrete strategies to use, is statically determined by the configuration of the application instead of a piece of code. Same goes for decorator, composite, observer, ...   2. The reason above leads to a design where functionality and data are separated. Because you don't want to let the DI container decide when data is created, you split any code off the data in order to have only this part managed by the DI container. This is contrary to the idea of OO where **code and data should reside together** in one unit. This breaks the **encapsulation of data** because all fields of the data \"beans\" are exposed by public getters and setters.   3. You can't use **polymorphism** anymore because code is not linked to its data anymore and the \"virtual functions\" can't work. This leads to those instanceof cascades that we all know we shouldn't use. Also, we lose all those designs that rely on polymorphism.   4. The DI container will inject managed beans only in objects which are also managed by it. So you can't **mix managed beans and normal objects** because there can't be any \"non-managed gaps\" in the reference chain of managed beans. So once you started with DI, you need to put all other code under the control of the DI container and you can't use normal objects anymore. I suppose that this is the reason why the separation of code and data is done so rigorously in DI projects. I see that there are reasons why to use DI but is it really worth giving up so much? Don't people care about OO? Apart from this **article** , I can't find any discussions on this topic. Or is it just me who doesn't understand how to do this properly? Any ideas how the four points above can be tackled with? **Appendix 1: Explanation of strategy pattern** I refer to the example here. Let's assume there's a DI version of it where all implementations of `Strategy` and the `Context` are injected to `StrategyExample`. Then `StrategyExample` doesn't decide anymore which `Strategy` to inject into `Context` but the configuration would have already decided which implementation to inject into `Context`. So yes, DI heavily applies the Strategy Pattern.

When a customer purchases the software we create a customer specific project which implements the bespoke code that they require, and pulls in the NuGet packages from the core libs as needed. The build of this project is what is provided to the customer, and each customer project has it's own Git repository. This has worked fine for a year or so, but I feel that as we add features to the core libraries the number of nuget packages is growing quite quickly. Is there a better method of organising code, whilst making sure there are not seperate version of the same code lying around? I know in this stackoverflow post it states that: > Google manages to keep the source code of all its projects, over 2000, in a > single code trunk containing hundreds of millions of code lines, with more > than 5,000 developers accessing the same repository. But this seems like it produce problems for us, due to having bespoke deployments. Any ideas or comments on what I am doing wrong? ## Edit The problems I foresee going with the google way are mainly to do with release management and build issues. We use continuous integration, so that every commit a build will be triggered and test automatically run. If we use one all encompassing repo I am not sure what effect this will have on the build and test servers. Will it have to build every customers project? Or would there be a branch per customer? In which case is this any better than a repo per customer?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Software Development", "Version Control"], "format": "Technical Article", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "TechBlog"}

Next week i'll be interviewing some contractors for a 6-month senior Dev position on a project. I'm an OK programmer myself, but nothing special, and at the moment i'm struggling to think of what questions to ask them, or what coding challenges i'd set, since the answers would likely go over my head anyway. The project is an ASP.NET MVC application for an intranet. My personal thought was to have them write a trivial MVC app that pulls some data from a DB during the interview, showing that they can implement a testable, loosely coupled application, but i don't know if this is _too_ trivial. From it i would expect them to have implemented a couple of tests, set up dependency injection, and probably use a repository instead of fat controllers. Any ideas, or is what i'm suggesting a bad idea? The coding part of the interview would likely last about 40 minutes. I timed myself doing what i'd planned and it took me just over half an hour. The candidates would have seen the requirements for the application a couple of days prior to the interview. From thinking about it a bit more, perhaps i should start off with a tightly coupled app, and ask the candidates to refactor it instead, and implement some tests?

Because the test to see if the loop should end is in the middle of a logical set of steps, the while loop itself currently doesn't check anything meaningful; the check is instead performed at the \"proper\" place within the conceptual algorithm. I was told that this is bad code, because it is more bug-prone due to the ending condition not being checked by the loop structure. It's more difficult to figure out how you'd exit the loop, and could invite bugs as the breaking condition might be bypassed or omitted accidentally given future changes. Now, the code could be structured as follows:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        TransformInSomeWay(input);             while(!ProcessingComplete(input))        {           DoSomethingElseTo(input);           TransformInSomeWay(input);        }     }      However, this duplicates a call to a method in code, violating DRY; if `TransformInSomeWay` were later replaced with some other method, both calls would have to be found and changed (and the fact that there are two may be less obvious in a more complex piece of code). You could also write it like:               public void doSomething(int input)     {        var complete = false;        while(!complete)        {           TransformInSomeWay(input);                complete = ProcessingComplete(input);                if(!complete)            {              DoSomethingElseTo(input);                     }        }     }      ... but you now have a variable whose only purpose is to shift the condition- checking to the loop structure, and also has to be checked multiple times to provide the same behavior as the original logic. For my part, I say that given the algorithm this code implements in the real world, the original code is the most readable. If you were going through it yourself, this is the way you'd think about it, and so it would be intuitive to people familiar with the algorithm. So, which is \"better\"? is it better to give the responsibility of condition checking to the while loop by structuring the logic around the loop? Or is it better to structure the logic in a \"natural\" way as indicated by requirements or a conceptual description of the algorithm, even though that may mean bypassing the loop's built-in capabilities?", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Programming", "Python"], "format": "Code Example", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Programming Forum"}

And in this question, one of the most popular answers says (again, my emphasis): > Developers can be testers, but they shouldn't be testers. **Developers tend > to unintentionally/unconciously avoid to use the application in a way that > might break it.** That's because they wrote it and mostly test it in the way > it should be used. So the question is _are programmers bad at testing?_ What evidence or arguments are there to support this conclusion? Are programmers only bad at testing their own code? Is there any evidence to suggest that programmers are actually _good_ at testing? What do I mean by \"testing?\" I do _not_ mean unit testing or anything that is considered part of the methodology used by the software team to write software. I mean some kind of quality assurance method that is used after the code has been built and deployed to whatever that software team would call the \"test environment.\"", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Developer", "keyword": ["Software Testing", "Quality Assurance"], "format": "Forum Post", "language": "English", "length": "Medium", "source": "Online Forum"}

We are dealing with work orders that are needed to maintain equipment. We have a bit of a disagreement in regards to the structure of the contract. There are two methods on my side, I would like a single work order class with all properties related to the work order in it. example (simplified)               WO - class       Number - property       Description - property       WarrantyStatus - property       WarrantySettlementDate - property       LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] - list property       Children<WO>[] - list property      On their side, they want to create a work order class, but for each logical group of data, they want to create another class to wrap the properties. example (simplified)               WO - class       WOHeader - class         Number - property         Description - property       Warranty - class         WarrantyStatus - property         WarrantySettlementDate - property       LabourSteps<LabourStep>[] - list property       Children<WO>[] - list property      Now they will have approx 8 classes in the full definition that they want to create all with a few properties in each. This seems a bit over the top to me and has a bit of a code smell or anti pattern feel to it. For my example, I have two classes, WO and LabourStep. They have 4 classes for the same thing WO,WOHeader,Warranty,LabourStep. There will only ever be one WOHeader per WO and the same for Warranty. My one seems far simpler to manage changes (add a new property to WO and thats it), but is less human readable. On their side, The structure is a little more easier to read by a human, but it feel like its pushing a logical view onto the contract the doesn't really belong. And to add a new property potentially requires a modification to the WO and the creation of a new class if a new logical group was added. These extra classes are only there to group properties. What is the right way to go? ======EDIT========== Frank - I completely agree with your thoughts and it is the way I approach my development. Except in this case, the third party monolithic enterprise system we are integrating with has been written in a very generic way to try and cater for as many businesses as possible. The data is spread across three tables in a one to one mapping with the majority in one table. There is barely any validation. There is no concept of a \"Warranty\" object/thing in that system. Its just 3 properties against a WO. All the web service will do is act like a data store, with the WO persisted as a whole. e.g. getWO() updateWO() createWO(). There will never be get/updateWarranty() methods. It's all just one blob of data to read/persist. On our side, we never use the result directly from web services even if they are our own. We convert them into proper models and then use those. To us a data contract is very different to a model. There is no business logic in the data contract, its purely a container to get data from one part of the system to another without closely coupling them. That means we can easily change to persist to a database instead of a web service and all its needs to do is match the interface of the web service. This also allows us to modify our own models which may even include results from multiple web services without having to worry about being restricted to or changing the format of the data contracts. So when I think in those terms, Having the data contracts split into WOHeader or WOWarranty classes just doesn't make any sense. It will never used in that way, not even by them. Its just there for a nice logical group of properties that mean nothing by themselves. A region block around those properties would have the same net effect. Labour steps and equipment details however, make a lot of sense to be in separate classes as they are separate entities and not just properties of work orders.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Software Developer", "keyword": ["Software Design", "Interface", "Data Structure"], "format": "Discussion", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Forum"}

In Joel Spolsky's famous (or infamous) article Thins You Should Never Do, Part I, he makes the case that doing a rewrite is always a wrong move because:   1. It automatically puts you behind (your competitors/schedule/etc.)   2. The code probably isn't as bad as the programmers believe (anything someone else wrote is always a mess, although some are bigger messes than others - and even then)   3. It's probably easier/quicker/cheaper to fix what's truly wrong with it than to rewrite from scratch.   4. In rewriting from scratch, you are probably going to re-introduce bugs that were fixed in previous versions the original code. Instead, he recommends fixing what's wrong with the code. I assume this is a good summary of his post, and I'll postulate that it is generally true. I'm trying to collect a set of rules/guideline for my team, and one of them (based on Joel's article) is               We don’t re-write ... ever!      - But we can refactor large portions of the code.       (this exception takes care of ugly/problematic code issues)      One question that has cropped up is \"What about when technology changes and you can no longer get support for older versions?\". This is what I think of as the Sisyphean Upgrade path. E.g., I recall when Oracle moved from SQL*Forms 2.x/3.x through to Forms 6i and beyond, Forms that were originality developed in the old .inp format were no longer supported with the current version of Oracle and Oracle Forms. So you had a choice of sticking with an unsupported database with unsupported tools or rewriting the Forms from scratch (or converted with 3rd party tools and then gone over with a fine toothed comb). Which I will call porting, particularly when you are doing a faithful line by line/function by function translation into the new tech and not adding any functionality. The rule then became:               We don’t re-write ... ever!     - But we can refactor large portions of the code.     - And we can port the code to a new platform when we *truly* have no other        choice.

Applications include the continuous authentication of radio and TV Internet broadcasts, and authenticated data distribution by satellite. The main challenges are fourfold.

Third, streamed media distribution can have high packet loss. Finally, the system needs to be efficient to support fast packet rates. We propose two efficient schemes, TESLA and EMSS, for secure lossy multicast streams.

This review provides a critical comparison of findings across individual studies and suggests that separate brain regions are involved in different aspects of emotion.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Psychology", "Neuroscience"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal"}

Mobility is a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society strives for safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs.

A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors, such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence. These steps are considered important for the interim period, until reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic situations becomes available.

It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of γ-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure. Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation. In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Image Processing"], "format": "Academic Article", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal"}

We experimentally confirm that all mainstream implementations of TLS share key materials between different algorithms, some of them of dubious strength. We outline attacks in their handling of resumption and renegotiation, stressing the need to model multiple related instances of the handshake. We study the provable security of the TLS handshake, as it is implemented and deployed. To capture the details of the standard and its main extensions, we rely on miTLS, a verified reference implementation of the protocol. miTLS inter-operates with mainstream browsers and servers for many protocol versions, configurations, and ciphersuites; and it provides application-level, provable security for some. We propose new agile security definitions and assumptions for the signatures, key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM), and key derivation algorithms used by the TLS handshake. By necessity, our definitions are stronger than those expected with simple modern protocols. To validate our model of key encapsulation, we prove that both RSA and Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites satisfy our definition for the KEM.

The novelties are that (1) decompression of arbitrary portions of the text can be done very efficiently, (2) exact search for words and phrases can be done on the compressed text directly, using any known sequential pattern-matching algorithm, and (3) word-based approximate and extended search can also be done efficiently without any decoding. The compression scheme uses a semistatic word-based model and a Huffman code where the coding alphabet is byte-oriented rather than bit-oriented. We compress typical English texts to about 30% of their original size, against 40% and 35% for Compress and Gzip, respectively. Compression time is close to that of Compress and approximately half of the time of Gzip, and decompression time is lower than that of Gzip and one third of that of Compress. We present three algorithms to search the compressed text. They allow a large number of variations over the basic word and phrase search capability, such as sets of characters, arbitrary regular expressions, and approximate matching. Separators and stopwords can be discarded at search time without significantly increasing the cost. When searching for simple words, the experiments show that running our algorithms on a compressed text is twice as fast as running the best existing software on the uncompressed version of the same text. When searching complex or approximate patterns, our algorithms are up to 8 times faster than the search on uncompressed text.

In this work we study real sessions manually labeled into hierarchical tasks, and show that timeouts, whatever their length, are of limited utility in identifying task boundaries, achieving a maximum precision of only 70%. We report on properties of this search task hierarchy, as seen in a random sample of user interactions from a major web search engine's log, annotated by human editors, learning that 17% of tasks are interleaved, and 20% are hierarchically organized.

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs.) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classi ers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["Computer Vision", "Machine Learning", "Ground Penetrating Radar"], "format": "Conference Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Proceedings of CVPR"}

Legs, tracks and wheels are all efficient means of ground locomotion that are most suitable in different situations. Legs allow to climb over obstacles and change the height of the robot, modifying its viewpoint of the world. Tracks are efficient on uneven terrains or on soft surfaces (snow, mud, etc.), while wheels are optimal on flat surfaces. Our objective is to work on a new concept capable of combining different locomotion mechanisms to increase the locomotion capabilities of the robotic platform. The design we came up with, called AZIMUT, is symmetrical and is made of four independent leg-track-wheel articulations. It can move with its articulations up, down or straight, allowing the robot to deal with three-dimensional environments. AZIMUT is also capable of moving sideways without changing its orientation, making it omnidirectional.

Among all the biometric identification methods, face recognition has attracted much attention in recent years because it has potential to be most nonintrusive and user-friendly. The PDBNN face recognition system consists of three modules: First, a face detector finds the location of a human face in an image. Then an eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes in order to generate meaningful feature vectors. The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes, and nose, but excluding mouth (eye-glasses will be allowed). Lastly, the third module is a face recognizer. The PDBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules. It adopts a hierarchical network structures with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. The paper demonstrates a successful application of PDBNN to face recognition applications on two public (FERET and ORL) and one in-house (SCR) databases. Regarding the performance, experimental results on three different databases such as recognition accuracies as well as false rejection and false acceptance rates are elaborated.

Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals.

HSI data often lie on sparse, nonlinear manifolds whose geometric and topological structures can be exploited via manifold-learning techniques. In this article, we focused on demonstrating the opportunities provided by manifold learning for classification of remotely sensed data. However, limitations and opportunities remain both for research and applications. Although these methods have been demonstrated to mitigate the impact of physical effects that affect electromagnetic energy traversing the atmosphere and reflecting from a target, nonlinearities are not always exhibited in the data, particularly at lower spatial resolutions, so users should always evaluate the inherent nonlinearity in the data. Manifold learning is data driven, and as such, results are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the data, and one method will not consistently provide the best results. Nonlinear manifold-learning methods require parameter tuning, although experimental results are typically stable over a range of values, and have higher computational overhead than linear methods, which is particularly relevant for large-scale remote sensing data sets. Opportunities for advancing manifold learning also exist for analysis of hyperspectral and multisource remotely sensed data. Manifolds are assumed to be inherently smooth, an assumption that some data sets may violate, and data often contain classes whose spectra are distinctly different, resulting in multiple manifolds or submanifolds that cannot be readily integrated with a single manifold representation. Developing appropriate characterizations that exploit the unique characteristics of these submanifolds for a particular data set is an open research problem for which hierarchical manifold structures appear to have merit. To date, most work in manifold learning has focused on feature extraction from single images, assuming stationarity across the scene.

This overfitting is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random “dropout” gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition. A feedforward, artificial neural network uses layers of non-linear hidden units between its inputs and its outputs. By adapting the weights on the incoming connections of these hidden units it learns feature detectors that enable it to predict the correct output when given an input vector [15]. If the relationship between the input and the correct output is complicated and the network has enough hidden units to model it accurately, there will typically be many different settings of the weights that can model the training set almost perfectly, especially if there is only a limited amount of labeled training data. Each of these weight vectors will make different predictions on held-out test data and almost all of them will do worse on the test data than on the training data because the feature detectors have been tuned to work well together on the training data but not on the test data. Overfitting can be reduced by using “dropout” to prevent complex co-adaptations on the training data. On each presentation of each training case, each hidden unit is randomly omitted from the network with a probability of 0.5, so a hidden unit cannot rely on other hidden units being present. Another way to view the dropout procedure is as a very efficient way of performing model averaging with neural networks. A good way to reduce the error on the test set is to average the predictions produced by a very large number of different networks. The standard way to do this is to train many separate networks and then to apply each of these networks to the test data, but this is computationally expensive during both training and testing. Random dropout makes it possible to train a huge number of different networks in a reasonable time. There is almost certainly a different network for each presentation of each training case but all of these networks share the same weights for the hidden units that are present. We use the standard, stochastic gradient descent procedure for training the dropout neural networks on mini-batches of training cases, but we modify the penalty term that is normally used to prevent the weights from growing too large. Instead of penalizing the squared length (L2 norm) of the whole weight vector, we set an upper bound on the L2 norm of the incoming weight vector for each individual hidden unit. If a weight-update violates this constraint, we renormalize the weights of the hidden unit by division. Using a constraint rather than a penalty prevents weights from growing very large no matter how large the proposed weight-update is.

Using figures from the Babel survey of multilinguality on the Web (h tZp : / /www. i s o c . o r g / ) , it is possible to estimate that as of June, 1997, there were on the order of 63000 primarily non-English Web servers, ranging over 14 languages.

Aiming to develop a systematic understanding of the interplay between social structure and mobile communications, in this paper we exploit social ties in human social networks to enhance cooperative device-to-device communications. Specifically, as hand-held devices are carried by human beings, we leverage two key social phenomena, namely social trust and social reciprocity, to promote efficient cooperation among devices. With this insight, we develop a coalitional game theoretic framework to devise social-tie based cooperation strategies for device-to-device communications. We also develop a network assisted relay selection mechanism to implement the coalitional game solution, and show that the mechanism is immune to group deviations, individually rational, and truthful. We evaluate the performance of the mechanism by using real social data traces. Numerical results show that the proposed mechanism can achieve up-to 122% performance gain over the case without D2D cooperation.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["IoT", "Operating Systems", "Resource Management", "Mobile Communications"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Research Journal"}

Deviceto- device (D2D) communications is a promising technique to provide wireless peer-to-peer services and enhance spectrum utilization in the LTE-Advanced networks. In D2D communications, the user equipments (UEs) are allowed to directly communicate between each other by reusing the cellular resources rather than using uplink and downlink resources in the cellular mode when communicating via the base station. However, enabling D2D communications in a cellular network poses two major challenges. First, the interference caused to the cellular users by D2D devices could critically affect the performances of the cellular devices. Second, the minimum quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of D2D communications need to be guaranteed. In this article, we introduce a novel resource allocation scheme (i.e. joint resource block scheduling and power control) for D2D communications in LTE-Advanced networks to maximize the spectrum utilization while addressing the above challenges. First, an overview of LTE-Advanced networks, and architecture and signaling support for provisioning of D2D communications in these networks are described. Furthermore, research issues and the current state-of-the-art of D2D communications are discussed. Then, a resource allocation scheme based on a column generation method is proposed for D2D communications. The objective is to maximize the spectrum utilization by finding the minimum transmission length in terms of time slots for D2D links while protecting the cellular users from harmful interference and guaranteeing the QoS of D2D links. The performance of this scheme is evaluated through simulations.", "relevance": 1, "audience": "Researcher", "keyword": ["IoT", "Resource Management", "Telecommunications"], "format": "Academic Paper", "language": "English", "length": "Long", "source": "Journal"}

Such events may include several entities or other relations. To evaluate the performance of the text mining systems, several shared task challenges have been arranged for the BioNLP community. With a common and consistent task setting, the BioNLP'09 shared task evaluated complex biomolecular events such as binding and regulation.Finding these events automatically is important in order to improve biomedical event extraction systems. In the present paper, we propose an automatic event extraction system, which contains a model for complex events, by solving a classification problem with rich features. The main contributions of the present paper are: (1) the proposal of an effective bio-event detection method using machine learning, (2) provision of a high-performance event extraction system, and (3) the execution of a quantitative error analysis.
